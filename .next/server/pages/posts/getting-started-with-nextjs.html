<p>Wait a second ... a &quot;framework&quot; for React? Isn&#x27;t React itself already a framework for JavaScript?</p>
<p>Well ... first of all, React is a &quot;library&quot; for JavaScript. That seems to be important for some people.</p>
<p>Not for me, but still, there is a valid point: React already is a framework / library for JavaScript. So it&#x27;s already an extra layer on top of JS.</p>
<h2>Why would we then need NextJS?</h2>
<p>Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).</p>
<p>In this article, we&#x27;ll dive into the core concepts and features NextJS has to offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>File-based Routing</li>
<li>Built-in Page Pre-rendering</li>
<li>Rich Data Fetching Capabilities</li>
<li>Image Optimization</li>
<li>Much More</li>
</ul>
<h2>File-based Routing</h2>
