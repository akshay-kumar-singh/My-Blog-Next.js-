<p><strong>(HTML)</strong></p>
<p>1.what is html ?</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
<li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</li>
<li>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</li>
<li>HTML consists of a series of elements</li>
<li>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</li>
<li>HTML elements label pieces of content such as &quot;this is a heading&quot;, &quot;this is a paragraph&quot;, &quot;this is a link&quot;, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>What is html tag, element, attribute ?</p>
<p><strong>HTML Tags:</strong> Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element. They begin with &lt; symbol and end with &gt; symbol. Whatever written inside &lt; and &gt; are called tags.</p>
<p><strong>HTML elements:</strong> Elements enclose the contents in between the tags. They consist of some kind of structure or expression. It generally consists of a start tag, content and an end tag.</p>
<p><strong>HTML Attributes:</strong> It is used to define the character of an HTML element. It always placed in the opening tag of an element. It generally provides additional styling (attribute) to the element.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marquee : -</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <!-- -->&lt;marquee&gt;<!-- --> tag in HTML is used to create scrolling text or image in a webpages. It scrolls either from horizontally left to right or right to left, or vertically top to bottom or bottom to top.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>List : -</li>
</ol>
<p>HTML Lists are used to specify lists of information. All lists may contain one or more list elements. There are three different types of HTML lists: Ordered List or Numbered List</p>
<p>(ol) Unordered List or Bulleted List (ul). Each list item starts with the <!-- -->&lt;li&gt;<!-- --> tag.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Table : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The <!-- -->&lt;table&gt;<!-- --> tag defines an HTML table. An HTML table consists of one <!-- -->&lt;table&gt;<!-- --> element and one or more <!-- -->&lt;tr&gt;<!-- -->, <!-- -->&lt;th&gt;<!-- -->, and <!-- -->&lt;td&gt;<!-- --> elements. The <!-- -->&lt;tr&gt;<!-- --> element defines a table row, the <!-- -->&lt;th&gt;<!-- --> element defines a table header, and the <!-- -->&lt;td&gt;<!-- --> element defines a table cell.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Copy : - &amp;#169 , @copy</li>
<li>White space : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Whitespace is any string of text composed only of spaces, tabs or line breaks (to be precise, CRLF sequences, carriage returns or line feeds). The whiteSpace property sets or returns how to handle tabs, line breaks and whitespace in a text.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Anchor tag / Hyperlink : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The <!-- -->&lt;a&gt;<!-- --> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the <!-- -->&lt;a&gt;<!-- --> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link&#x27;s destination. By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers: An unvisited link is underlined and blue.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Semantic html : -</li>
</ol>
<p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: <!-- -->&lt;div&gt;<!-- --> and <!-- -->&lt;span&gt;<!-- --> - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: <!-- -->&lt;form&gt;<!-- --> , <!-- -->&lt;table&gt;<!-- --> , and <!-- -->&lt;article&gt;<!-- --> - Clearly defines its content.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>SVG : -</li>
</ol>
<p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. SVG is used to define graphics for the Web.</p>
<p>The SVG file format is a popular tool for displaying two-dimensional graphics, charts, and illustrations on websites. Plus, as a vector file, it can be scaled up or down without losing any of its resolution.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>i-frame tag : -</li>
</ol>
<p>What is inline frame (iframe)? An inline frame (iframe) is a HTML element that loads another HTML page within the document. It essentially puts another webpage within the parent page. They are commonly used for advertisements, embedded videos, web analytics and interactive content.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Imp of doctype : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Per HTML and XHTML standards, a DOCTYPE (short for “document type declaration”) informs the web browser which version of HTML you&#x27;re using, and should appear at the very top of every web page. DOCTYPE&#x27;s are a key component of standards-compliant web pages, plus your code won&#x27;t render correctly or validate without them.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Metadata : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Metadata is data (information) about data. <!-- -->&lt;meta&gt;<!-- --> tags always go inside the <!-- -->&lt;head&gt;<!-- --> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Pre tag : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The <!-- -->&lt;pre&gt;<!-- --> tag defines preformatted text. Text in a <!-- -->&lt;pre&gt;<!-- --> element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks. The text will be displayed exactly as written in the HTML source code.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Div and span tag : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The <!-- -->&lt;span&gt;<!-- --> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The <!-- -->&lt;span&gt;<!-- --> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The <!-- -->&lt;span&gt;<!-- --> tag is much like the <!-- -->&lt;div&gt;<!-- --> element, but <!-- -->&lt;div&gt;<!-- --> is a block-level element and <!-- -->&lt;span&gt;<!-- --> is an inline element.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>GET VS POST :-</li>
</ol>
<p>Both GET and POST method is used to transfer data from client to server in HTTP protocol but Main difference between POST and GET method is that GET carries request parameter appended in URL string while POST carries request parameter in message body which makes it more secure way of transferring data from client to …</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Html vs html 5 : -</li>
</ol>
<p>HTML5 is a new version of HTML with new functionalities with markup language with Internet technologies. HTML does not have support for video and audio but, HTML5 supports both video and audio. You must be visiting many websites every day. Let us talk about an online shopping website.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Frames : -</li>
</ol>
<p>HTML frames are used to divide your browser window into multiple sections where each section can load a separate HTML document. A collection of frames in the browser window is known as a frameset. The window is divided into frames in a similar way the tables are organized: into rows and columns.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>Inline vs block level element : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element. Block elements have top and bottom margins. Inline elements don&#x27;t have a top and bottom margin.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Viewport : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The viewport is the user&#x27;s visible area of a web page.</p>
<p>The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.</p>
<p>Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.</p>
<p>This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page&#x27;s dimensions and scaling.</p>
<p>The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).</p>
<p>The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>Cell spacing vs cell padding : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Both cellpadding and cellspacing are used to insert whitespaces in the table cells. The most basic difference between cellpadding and cellspacing is that the cellpadding is used to set the whitespace between cell edge and cell content, whereas cellspacing is used to set the whitespace between two cells.</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>Web workers : -</li>
</ol>
<p>A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>Id vs class : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember the difference between Class and ID: A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must only be used by one HTML element within the page</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Formatting tag : -</li>
</ol>
<p>HTML Formatting is a process that allows us to format text to increase its visual appeal. Various HTML tags can change how text appears on a web page and make the text attractive. We can use HTML text formatting tags to bold, italicize, underlined text, and do more.</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>Link : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The <!-- -->&lt;link&gt;<!-- --> tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. The <!-- -->&lt;link&gt;<!-- --> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets or to add a favicon to your website.</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>Image map : -</li>
</ol>
<p>An image map is an image with clickable areas. The required name attribute of the <!-- -->&lt;map&gt;<!-- --> element is associated with the <!-- -->&lt;img&gt;<!-- -->&#x27;s usemap attribute and creates a relationship between the image and the map. The <!-- -->&lt;map&gt;<!-- --> element contains a number of <!-- -->&lt;area&gt;<!-- --> elements, that defines the clickable areas in the image map.</p>
<ol start="27">
<li>Layout : -</li>
</ol>
<p>An HTML layout is a blueprint used to arrange web pages in a well-defined manner. It is easy to navigate, simple to understand and uses HTML tags to customize web design elements. Crucial for any website, an HTML layout that uses the correct format will easily improve a website&#x27;s appearance.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>Local storage vs Session storage : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page</p>
<p>sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>Media types &amp; Formats : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files. The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension. Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>Html vs Xhtml : -</li>
</ol>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, whereas XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. XHTML is basically an extension of HTML, which is stricter than HTML. Both languages are used to create web and Android applications. HTML is SGML based, whereas XHTML is an XML-based language.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>Input tag : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Definition and Usage. The <!-- -->&lt;input&gt;<!-- --> tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data. The <!-- -->&lt;input&gt;<!-- --> element is the most important form element. The <!-- -->&lt;input&gt;<!-- --> element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>Form : -</li>
</ol>
<p>HTML Form is a document that stores information of a user on a web server using interactive controls. An HTML form contains different kinds of information such as username, password, contact number, email id, etc. The elements used in an HTML form are the check box, input box, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>Range slider : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The <!-- -->&lt;input type=&quot;range&quot;&gt;<!-- --> defines a control for entering a number whose exact value is not important (like a slider control). Default range is 0 to 100. However, you can set restrictions on what numbers are accepted with the attributes below.</p>
<ol start="34">
<li>Entities : -</li>
</ol>
<p>HTML entities are the reserved characters that are used in the HTML document. They are not present in your standard keyboard. They provide a wide range of characters, allowing you to add icons, geometric shapes, mathematical operators, and so on.</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>Optimize website asset : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Optimizing website asset loading involves a meticulous process of enhancing the delivery of various elements that make up a web page, including images, scripts, stylesheets, fonts, and multimedia content. The goal is to reduce loading times while maintaining or even enhancing the quality of the user experience.</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>URL Encoding : -</li>
</ol>
<p>URL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet. URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a &quot;%&quot; followed by hexadecimal digits. URLs cannot contain spaces.</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>Datalist tag : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The <!-- -->&lt;datalist&gt;<!-- --> tag specifies a list of pre-defined options for an <!-- -->&lt;input&gt;<!-- --> element. The <!-- -->&lt;datalist&gt;<!-- --> tag is used to provide an &quot;autocomplete&quot; feature for <!-- -->&lt;input&gt;<!-- --> elements. Users will see a drop-down list of pre-defined options as they input data.</p>
<ol start="38">
<li>Canvas element : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The HTML <!-- -->&lt;canvas&gt;<!-- --> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The <!-- -->&lt;canvas&gt;<!-- --> element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.</p>
<p>- css -</p>
<p>1.What is css : -</p>
<p>CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Types : -</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>There are three types of CSS which are given below:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inline CSS.</li>
<li>Internal or Embedded CSS.</li>
<li>External CSS.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Css selectors : -</li>
</ol>
<p>CSS selectors are used to &quot;find&quot; (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>
<p>We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp">Combinator selectors</a> (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp">Pseudo-class selectors</a> (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp">Pseudo-elements selectors</a> (select and style a part of an element)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_attribute_selectors.asp">Attribute selectors</a> (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Universal selector : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The asterisk (*) is known as the CSS universal selectors. It can be used to select any and all types of elements in an HTML page. The asterisk can also be followed by a selector while using to select a child object. This selector is useful when we want to select all the elements on the page.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Box sizing : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element&#x27;s total width and height. If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height: Both divs are the same size now!</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Hide an element : -</li>
</ol>
<p>You can hide an element in CSS using the CSS properties display: none or visibility: hidden . display: none removes the entire element from the page and mat affect the layout of the page.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Flex model : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The flexbox or flexible box model in CSS is a one-dimensional layout model that has flexible and efficient layouts with distributed spaces among items to control their alignment structure ie., it is a layout model that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items within a container.</p>
<p>In a perfect world of browser support, the reason you&#x27;d choose to use flexbox is because you want to lay a collection of items out in one direction or another. As you lay out your items you want to control the dimensions of the items in that one dimension, or control the spacing between items.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Important : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal. In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Css Sprites : -</li>
</ol>
<p>CSS Sprites are a collection of images that are combined into a single file that an HTML document can access. These images are then called into use within the HTML code to be displayed on the website.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Pseudo class / Pseudo element : -</li>
</ol>
<p>In CSS, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are two types of keywords that you can combine with selectors. They are used to target the element&#x27;s state or specific parts of an element.</p>
<p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class :hover can be used to select a button when a user&#x27;s pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can then be styled.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>SASS , LESS , STYLUS : -</li>
</ol>
<p>LESS is pretty intuitive and more CSS-like.</p>
<p>SASS is more programmatic than it is CSS-like, although it supports all versions of CSS.</p>
<p>Stylus is more concise, intuitive and is just as programmatic as SASS. This is due to the fact that they are both imperatively styled.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Position relative vs Position absolute : -</li>
</ol>
<p>a relative position moves the element, but still consumes some space in the original position. an absolute or fixed position moves the element, but does not consume any layout space.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>VH : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The full form of VH is viewport height. It works like the percentage unit as well. Specifying 10vh is equivalent to occupying 10% of entire visible screen height.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>CSS3 vs CSS2 : -</li>
</ol>
<p>CSS3 has compatibility with external font styles through google fonts and typecast. It was not possible with earlier CSS1 and CSS2. The selectors in CSS3 has increased while CSS1 and CSS2 only had simple selectors. CSS1 AND CSS2 didn&#x27;t have provision to specifically design the web layout.CSS3 is now split into different modules. Since each module makes its way through the W3C individually, there&#x27;s a wider range of browser support. Make sure you test your CSS3 pages in as many browsers and operating systems as possible to ensure compatibility</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>RGB stream : -</li>
</ol>
<p>RGB represents colors in CSS. There are three streams in this nomenclature representing a color, namely the Red, Green, and Blue streams. The intensity of colors is represented using numbers 0 to 255. This allows CSS to have a spectrum of visible colors.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>Class vs Id : -</li>
</ol>
<p>While an ID is specific to a single element, classes can be assigned to multiple elements on a page or throughout the website. They are not unique. And while a single element can only have one ID, it can have multiple classes.</p>
<p>To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.</p>
<p>To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Z-index : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Z Index ( z-index ) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index. Note: Z index only works on positioned elements ( position:absolute , position:relative , or position:fixed ).</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Media types : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.</p>
<p>Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.<img src="Aspose.Words.fc9b058b-e705-4e5e-a7d2-b93d9b27b1f7.001.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>CSS3 Introduced Media Queries</p>
<p>Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.</p>
<p>Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>width and height of the viewport</li>
<li>width and height of the device</li>
<li>orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)</li>
<li>resolution</li>
</ul>
<p>Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>Image repetition : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The CSS background-repeat is what you&#x27;re looking for. If you want the background image not to repeat at all, use background-repeat: no-repeat;</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Image scroll : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Background-repeat : none; Background-attachment : fixed;</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>Font related attributes : -</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>font-family.</li>
<li>font-size.</li>
<li>font-stretch.</li>
<li>font-style.</li>
<li>font-variant.</li>
<li>font-weight.</li>
<li>line-height.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="22">
<li>Contextual selectors : -</li>
</ol>
<p>A contextual selector matches when an element is an arbitrary descendent of some ancestor element (i.e., it may be any generation below the ancestor element). A contextual selector is made up of two or more selectors separated by white space.</p>
<p>Contextual selectors allow the developer to select different types of styles for different parts of the document. In CSS, the developer can either specify styles directly or by making certain classes. The contextual selector will only apply the style to the elements which are specified.</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>Css nomenclature : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The CSS class naming convention defines rules for choosing the character sequences for naming a CSS class to reduce the effort needed to read and understand the code. There are various naming conventions, like using hyphen-delimited strings, BEM(Block-Element-Modifier), OOCSS(Object-oriented CSS), etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Naming Convention Basics.</li>
<li>Do Not Use Special Characters.</li>
<li>Do Not Use Any Spaces.</li>
<li>The Filename Should Start With a Letter.</li>
<li>Use All Lower Case.</li>
<li>Keep the Filename as Short as Possible.</li>
<li>The Most Important Part of Your CSS Filename.</li>
<li>CSS File-Naming Conventions.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="24">
<li>When should you use translate () instead of absolute positioning in</li>
</ol>
<p>CSS?</p>
<p>Use translate() when you need to move an element without affecting the layout of other elements on the page. Consider using translate() instead of absolute positioning in scenarios such as animations, responsive design, and small adjustments to element positions.</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>Position some aspect : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The <!-- -->&lt;position&gt;<!-- --> (or <!-- -->&lt;bg-position&gt;<!-- --> ) CSS data type denotes a two-dimensional coordinate used to set a location relative to an element box. It is used in the background-position and offset-anchor properties. Note: The final position described by the <!-- -->&lt;position&gt;<!-- --> value does not need to be inside the element&#x27;s box</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>Mixins : -</li>
</ol>
<p>A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. Here&#x27;s an example for theme . SCSS.</p>
<p>Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet. They make it easy to avoid using non-semantic classes like .float-left , and to distribute collections of styles in libraries.</p>
<ol start="27">
<li>How does browser work under the hood?</li>
</ol>
<p>Each browser has a browser engine under the hood. It works as a bridge between the user interface and the rendering engine. It queries and manipulates the rendering engine based on the input it gets from the user interface.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>Float : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning).</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>Logical vs physical tag : -</li>
</ol>
<p>a logical tag is a tag that describes the meaning or structure of the content it surrounds, while a physical tag describes the presentation or appearance of the content.</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>Image scripts : -</li>
</ol>
<p>An image sprite is a collection of images put into a single image. A web page with many images can take a long time to load and generates multiple server requests. Using image sprites will reduce the number of server requests and save bandwidth.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>Position static : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.</p>
<p>There are five different position values:</p>
<ul>
<li>static</li>
<li>relative</li>
<li>fixed</li>
<li>absolute</li>
<li>sticky ●</li>
</ul>
<ol start="32">
<li>Attribute selectors : -</li>
</ol>
<p>This type of attribute selector is used to select all the elements that have the specified attribute and applies the CSS property to that attribute. For example, the selector [class] will select all the elements with the style attribute</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>Child selectors : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.</p>
<ol start="34">
<li>Css framework : -</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Top 5 CSS Frameworks for Developers and Designers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap.</li>
<li>Tailwind CSS.</li>
<li>Foundation.</li>
<li>Bulma.</li>
<li>Skeleton.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="35">
<li>Ruleset : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The CSS Ruleset is used to apply a set of properties with some define values for the element or a specific set of elements that are used in the HTML page.</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>Embedded style sheet : -</li>
</ol>
<p>It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. This is done by embedding the <!-- -->&lt;style&gt;<!-- -->&lt;/style&gt;<!-- --> tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document.</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>Reset vs normalize css : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Normalizing retains the default styles that are useful and removes those that are not whereas the reset removes all the styles of the browser. In reset, we will have to re declare all the styles after resetting the browser whereas, normalizing will keep the required styles and only removes the unwanted ones</p>
<ol start="38">
<li>Adaptive vs responsive desing : -</li>
</ol>
<p>A responsive design can change its layout and appearance based on the screen size of the device it&#x27;s accessed on, from a large desktop computer to a small mobile phone. An adaptive design requires the creation of a different layout for each device the website will be accessed on</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>Center a div : -</li>
</ol>
<p>.parent {</p>
<p>background: gray; height: 300px; width: 300px; position: relative;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>.child {</p>
<p>background-color: orange; position: absolute;</p>
<p>top: 50%;</p>
<p>left: 50%;</p>
<p>transform: translate(-50%,-50%);</p>
<p>}</p>
<ol start="40">
<li>Grid system : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The CSS grid layout module excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives. Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows.</p>
<ol start="41">
<li>Grid vs flex box : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The basic difference between CSS grid layout and CSS flexbox layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.</p>
<ol start="42">
<li>Progressive rendering : -</li>
</ol>
<p>In progressive Rendering, the web page is divided into different parts on the basis of priority. So different parts will be rendered sequentially according to Server-Side Rendering and sent to the client side</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>Reset.css file : -</li>
</ol>
<p>A CSS Reset file circumvents inconsistencies across different browsers when developing websites. All browsers have default rules with properties and values applied to all pages before loading files. Due to the cascading nature of CSS, any styles the browser uses will remain unless explicitly overridden</p>
<ol start="44">
<li>Box model vs box sizing : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The box model refers to the composition of elements on a page. When you specify the height or width of an element, you&#x27;re setting the content size—any padding, border, and margin will be added to that. Applying box-sizing: border-box to an element changes the box model to a more predictable behavior.</p>
<ol start="45">
<li>Css variables : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The var() function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable.</p>
<p>CSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that you can create variables with local or global scope, change the variables with JavaScript, and change the variables based on media queries.</p>
<p>A good way to use CSS variables is when it comes to the colors of your design. Instead of copy and paste the same colors over and over again, you can place them in variables.</p>
<ol start="46">
<li>Display property : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline box and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex. Formally, the display property sets an element&#x27;s inner and outer display types.</p>
<ol start="47">
<li>
<p>Direct child selectors and descendent child selector in css : -</p>
<p>The Child Combinator (&gt;) only selects those HTML Elements that are direct children of a specified element. While the Descendant Combinator selects all HTML Elements that are either children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and so on. They all are descendants of a specified element and thus all are selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Margin vs padding : -</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In CSS, a margin is the space around an element&#x27;s border, while padding is the space between an element&#x27;s border and the element&#x27;s content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.</p>
<ol start="49">
<li>Media breakpoint for responsive : -</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Mobile devices – 320px — 480px.</li>
<li>iPads, Tablets – 481px — 768px.</li>
<li>Small screens, laptops – 769px — 1024px.</li>
<li>Desktops, large screens – 1025px — 1200px.</li>
<li>Extra large screens, TV – 1201px, and more.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="50">
<li>Bem methodology : -</li>
</ol>
<p>BEM is a front-end naming method for organizing and naming CSS classes. The Block, Element, Modifier methodology is a popular naming convention for class names in HTML and CSS</p>
<ol start="51">
<li>Em vs rem : -</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically that both rem and em are scalable and relative units of size, but with em, the unit is relative to the font size of its parent element, while the rem unit is only relative to the root font size of the HTML document. The “r” in rem stands for “root”</p>
<ol start="52">
<li>Specificity : -</li>
</ol>
<p>If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will &quot;win&quot;, and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.</p>
<ol start="53">
<li>
<p>Diff b/w static,relative,absolute and fixed position : -</p>
<p>Static - this is the default value, all elements are in order as they appear in the document. Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position. Absolute - the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent. Fixed - the element is positioned related to the browser window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gradient : -</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Gradient Backgrounds. CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors. CSS defines three types of gradients: Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally) Radial Gradients (defined by their center)</p>
<ol start="55">
<li>Calc () : -</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be used to calculate length, percentage, time, number, integer frequency, or angle. It uses the four simple arithmetic operators add (+), multiply (*), subtract (-), and divide (/). It is a powerful CSS concept because it allows us to mix any units, such as percentage and pixel.</p>
<ol start="56">
<li>Word wrap : -</li>
</ol>
<p>The word-wrap property allows long words to be able to be broken and wrap onto the next line.</p>
<ol start="57">
<li>Shadow effect : -</li>
</ol>
<p>With CSS you can add shadow to text and to elements.</p>
<p>h1 { text-shadow: 2px 2px;}</p>
<ol start="58">
<li>Transition : -</li>
</ol>
<p>CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.</p>

You probably don't know it well enough!","image":"html.png","isFeatured":false,"date":"2021-10-30","content":"\r\n**INTERVIEW**\r\n\r\n**(HTML)**\r\n\r\n1\\.what is html ?\r\n\r\n- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language\r\n- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages\r\n- HTML describes the structure of a Web page\r\n- HTML consists of a series of elements\r\n- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content\r\n- HTML elements label pieces of content such as \"this is a heading\", \"this is a paragraph\", \"this is a link\", etc.\r\n2. What is html tag, element, attribute ?\r\n\r\n   **HTML Tags:** Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element. They begin with \u003c symbol and end with \u003e symbol. Whatever written inside \u003c and \u003e are called tags.\r\n\r\n   **HTML elements:** Elements enclose the contents in between the tags. They consist of some kind of structure or expression. It generally consists of a start tag, content and an end tag.\r\n\r\n   **HTML Attributes:** It is used to define the character of an HTML element. It always placed in the opening tag of an element. It generally provides additional styling (attribute) to the element.\r\n\r\n3. Marquee : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003cmarquee\u003e tag in HTML is used to create scrolling text or image in a webpages. It scrolls either from horizontally left to right or right to left, or vertically top to bottom or bottom to top.\r\n\r\n4. List : -\r\n\r\nHTML Lists are used to specify lists of information. All lists may contain one or more list elements. There are three different types of HTML lists: Ordered List or Numbered List\r\n\r\n(ol) Unordered List or Bulleted List (ul). Each list item starts with the \u003cli\u003e tag.\r\n\r\n5. Table : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003ctable\u003e tag defines an HTML table. An HTML table consists of one \u003ctable\u003e element and one or more \u003ctr\u003e, \u003cth\u003e, and \u003ctd\u003e elements. The \u003ctr\u003e element defines a table row, the \u003cth\u003e element defines a table header, and the \u003ctd\u003e element defines a table cell.\r\n\r\n6. Copy : - \u0026#169 , @copy\r\n6. White space : -\r\n\r\nWhitespace is any string of text composed only of spaces, tabs or line breaks (to be precise, CRLF sequences, carriage returns or line feeds). The whiteSpace property sets or returns how to handle tabs, line breaks and whitespace in a text.\r\n\r\n8. Anchor tag / Hyperlink : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003ca\u003e tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the \u003ca\u003e element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers: An unvisited link is underlined and blue.\r\n\r\n9. Semantic html : -\r\n\r\nA semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: \u003cdiv\u003e and \u003cspan\u003e - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: \u003cform\u003e , \u003ctable\u003e , and \u003carticle\u003e - Clearly defines its content.\r\n\r\n10. SVG : -\r\n\r\nSVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. SVG is used to define graphics for the Web.\r\n\r\nThe SVG file format is a popular tool for displaying two-dimensional graphics, charts, and illustrations on websites. Plus, as a vector file, it can be scaled up or down without losing any of its resolution.\r\n\r\n11. i-frame tag : -\r\n\r\nWhat is inline frame (iframe)? An inline frame (iframe) is a HTML element that loads another HTML page within the document. It essentially puts another webpage within the parent page. They are commonly used for advertisements, embedded videos, web analytics and interactive content.\r\n\r\n12. Imp of doctype : -\r\n\r\nPer HTML and XHTML standards, a DOCTYPE (short for “document type declaration”) informs the web browser which version of HTML you're using, and should appear at the very top of every web page. DOCTYPE's are a key component of standards-compliant web pages, plus your code won't render correctly or validate without them.\r\n\r\n13. Metadata : -\r\n\r\nMetadata is data (information) about data. \u003cmeta\u003e tags always go inside the \u003chead\u003e element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.\r\n\r\n14. Pre tag : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003cpre\u003e tag defines preformatted text. Text in a \u003cpre\u003e element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks. The text will be displayed exactly as written in the HTML source code.\r\n\r\n15. Div and span tag : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003cspan\u003e tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The \u003cspan\u003e tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The \u003cspan\u003e tag is much like the \u003cdiv\u003e element, but \u003cdiv\u003e is a block-level element and \u003cspan\u003e is an inline element.\r\n\r\n16. GET VS POST :-\r\n\r\nBoth GET and POST method is used to transfer data from client to server in HTTP protocol but Main difference between POST and GET method is that GET carries request parameter appended in URL string while POST carries request parameter in message body which makes it more secure way of transferring data from client to …\r\n\r\n17. Html vs html 5 : -\r\n\r\nHTML5 is a new version of HTML with new functionalities with markup language with Internet technologies. HTML does not have support for video and audio but, HTML5 supports both video and audio. You must be visiting many websites every day. Let us talk about an online shopping website.\r\n\r\n18. Frames : -\r\n\r\nHTML frames are used to divide your browser window into multiple sections where each section can load a separate HTML document. A collection of frames in the browser window is known as a frameset. The window is divided into frames in a similar way the tables are organized: into rows and columns.\r\n\r\n19. Inline vs block level element : -\r\n\r\nBlock elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element. Block elements have top and bottom margins. Inline elements don't have a top and bottom margin.\r\n\r\n20. Viewport : -\r\n\r\nThe viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.\r\n\r\nThe viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.\r\n\r\nBefore tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.\r\n\r\nThis gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.\r\n\r\nThe width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).\r\n\r\nThe initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.\r\n\r\n21. Cell spacing vs cell padding : -\r\n\r\nBoth cellpadding and cellspacing are used to insert whitespaces in the table cells. The most basic difference between cellpadding and cellspacing is that the cellpadding is used to set the whitespace between cell edge and cell content, whereas cellspacing is used to set the whitespace between two cells.\r\n\r\n22. Web workers : -\r\n\r\nA web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.\r\n\r\n23. Id vs class : -\r\n\r\nRemember the difference between Class and ID: A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must only be used by one HTML element within the page\r\n\r\n24. Formatting tag : -\r\n\r\nHTML Formatting is a process that allows us to format text to increase its visual appeal. Various HTML tags can change how text appears on a web page and make the text attractive. We can use HTML text formatting tags to bold, italicize, underlined text, and do more.\r\n\r\n25. Link : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003clink\u003e tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. The \u003clink\u003e tag is most often used to link to external style sheets or to add a favicon to your website.\r\n\r\n26. Image map : -\r\n\r\nAn image map is an image with clickable areas. The required name attribute of the \u003cmap\u003e element is associated with the \u003cimg\u003e's usemap attribute and creates a relationship between the image and the map. The \u003cmap\u003e element contains a number of \u003carea\u003e elements, that defines the clickable areas in the image map.\r\n\r\n27. Layout : -\r\n\r\nAn HTML layout is a blueprint used to arrange web pages in a well-defined manner. It is easy to navigate, simple to understand and uses HTML tags to customize web design elements. Crucial for any website, an HTML layout that uses the correct format will easily improve a website's appearance.\r\n\r\n28. Local storage vs Session storage : -\r\n\r\nThe difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page\r\n\r\nsessions are valid for only one tab at a time.\r\n\r\n29. Media types \u0026 Formats : -\r\n\r\nMultimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files. The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension. Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.\r\n\r\n30. Html vs Xhtml : -\r\n\r\nHTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, whereas XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. XHTML is basically an extension of HTML, which is stricter than HTML. Both languages are used to create web and Android applications. HTML is SGML based, whereas XHTML is an XML-based language.\r\n\r\n31. Input tag : -\r\n\r\nDefinition and Usage. The \u003cinput\u003e tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data. The \u003cinput\u003e element is the most important form element. The \u003cinput\u003e element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.\r\n\r\n32. Form : -\r\n\r\nHTML Form is a document that stores information of a user on a web server using interactive controls. An HTML form contains different kinds of information such as username, password, contact number, email id, etc. The elements used in an HTML form are the check box, input box, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.\r\n\r\n33. Range slider : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003cinput type=\"range\"\u003e defines a control for entering a number whose exact value is not important (like a slider control). Default range is 0 to 100. However, you can set restrictions on what numbers are accepted with the attributes below.\r\n\r\n34. Entities : -\r\n\r\nHTML entities are the reserved characters that are used in the HTML document. They are not present in your standard keyboard. They provide a wide range of characters, allowing you to add icons, geometric shapes, mathematical operators, and so on.\r\n\r\n35. Optimize website asset : -\r\n\r\nOptimizing website asset loading involves a meticulous process of enhancing the delivery of various elements that make up a web page, including images, scripts, stylesheets, fonts, and multimedia content. The goal is to reduce loading times while maintaining or even enhancing the quality of the user experience.\r\n\r\n36. URL Encoding : -\r\n\r\nURL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet. URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a \"%\" followed by hexadecimal digits. URLs cannot contain spaces.\r\n\r\n37. Datalist tag : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003cdatalist\u003e tag specifies a list of pre-defined options for an \u003cinput\u003e element. The \u003cdatalist\u003e tag is used to provide an \"autocomplete\" feature for \u003cinput\u003e elements. Users will see a drop-down list of pre-defined options as they input data.\r\n\r\n38. Canvas element : -\r\n\r\nThe HTML \u003ccanvas\u003e element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The \u003ccanvas\u003e element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.\r\n\r\n\\- css -\r\n\r\n1\\.What is css : -\r\n\r\nCSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files\r\n\r\n2. Types : -\r\n\r\n**There are three types of CSS which are given below:**\r\n\r\n- Inline CSS.\r\n- Internal or Embedded CSS.\r\n- External CSS.\r\n3. Css selectors : -\r\n\r\nCSS selectors are used to \"find\" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.\r\n\r\nWe can divide CSS selectors into five categories:\r\n\r\n- Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)\r\n- [Combinator selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp) (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)\r\n- [Pseudo-class selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp) (select elements based on a certain state)\r\n- [Pseudo-elements selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp) (select and style a part of an element)\r\n- [Attribute selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_attribute_selectors.asp) (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)\r\n4. Universal selector : -\r\n\r\nThe asterisk (\\*) is known as the CSS universal selectors. It can be used to select any and all types of elements in an HTML page. The asterisk can also be followed by a selector while using to select a child object. This selector is useful when we want to select all the elements on the page.\r\n\r\n5. Box sizing : -\r\n\r\nThe box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height. If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height: Both divs are the same size now!\r\n\r\n6. Hide an element : -\r\n\r\nYou can hide an element in CSS using the CSS properties display: none or visibility: hidden . display: none removes the entire element from the page and mat affect the layout of the page.\r\n\r\n7. Flex model : -\r\n\r\nThe flexbox or flexible box model in CSS is a one-dimensional layout model that has flexible and efficient layouts with distributed spaces among items to control their alignment structure ie., it is a layout model that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items within a container.\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world of browser support, the reason you'd choose to use flexbox is because you want to lay a collection of items out in one direction or another. As you lay out your items you want to control the dimensions of the items in that one dimension, or control the spacing between items.\r\n\r\n8. Important : -\r\n\r\nThe !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal. In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!\r\n\r\n9. Css Sprites : -\r\n\r\nCSS Sprites are a collection of images that are combined into a single file that an HTML document can access. These images are then called into use within the HTML code to be displayed on the website.\r\n\r\n10. Pseudo class / Pseudo element : -\r\n\r\nIn CSS, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are two types of keywords that you can combine with selectors. They are used to target the element's state or specific parts of an element.\r\n\r\nA CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class :hover can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can then be styled.\r\n\r\n11. SASS , LESS , STYLUS : -\r\n\r\nLESS is pretty intuitive and more CSS-like.\r\n\r\nSASS is more programmatic than it is CSS-like, although it supports all versions of CSS.\r\n\r\nStylus is more concise, intuitive and is just as programmatic as SASS. This is due to the fact that they are both imperatively styled.\r\n\r\n12. Position relative vs Position absolute : -\r\n\r\na relative position moves the element, but still consumes some space in the original position. an absolute or fixed position moves the element, but does not consume any layout space.\r\n\r\n13. VH : -\r\n\r\nThe full form of VH is viewport height. It works like the percentage unit as well. Specifying 10vh is equivalent to occupying 10% of entire visible screen height.\r\n\r\n14. CSS3 vs CSS2 : -\r\n\r\nCSS3 has compatibility with external font styles through google fonts and typecast. It was not possible with earlier CSS1 and CSS2. The selectors in CSS3 has increased while CSS1 and CSS2 only had simple selectors. CSS1 AND CSS2 didn't have provision to specifically design the web layout.CSS3 is now split into different modules. Since each module makes its way through the W3C individually, there's a wider range of browser support. Make sure you test your CSS3 pages in as many browsers and operating systems as possible to ensure compatibility\r\n\r\n15. RGB stream : -\r\n\r\nRGB represents colors in CSS. There are three streams in this nomenclature representing a color, namely the Red, Green, and Blue streams. The intensity of colors is represented using numbers 0 to 255. This allows CSS to have a spectrum of visible colors.\r\n\r\n16. Class vs Id : -\r\n\r\nWhile an ID is specific to a single element, classes can be assigned to multiple elements on a page or throughout the website. They are not unique. And while a single element can only have one ID, it can have multiple classes.\r\n\r\nTo select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.\r\n\r\nTo select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.\r\n\r\n17. Z-index : -\r\n\r\nZ Index ( z-index ) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index. Note: Z index only works on positioned elements ( position:absolute , position:relative , or position:fixed ).\r\n\r\n18. Media types : -\r\n\r\nThe @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.\r\n\r\nExamples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.![](Aspose.Words.fc9b058b-e705-4e5e-a7d2-b93d9b27b1f7.001.png)\r\n\r\nCSS3 Introduced Media Queries\r\n\r\nMedia queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.\r\n\r\nMedia queries can be used to check many things, such as:\r\n\r\n- width and height of the viewport\r\n- width and height of the device\r\n- orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)\r\n- resolution\r\n\r\nUsing media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).\r\n\r\n19. Image repetition : -\r\n\r\nThe CSS background-repeat is what you're looking for. If you want the background image not to repeat at all, use background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n\r\n20. Image scroll : -\r\n\r\nBackground-repeat : none; Background-attachment : fixed;\r\n\r\n21. Font related attributes : -\r\n- font-family.\r\n- font-size.\r\n- font-stretch.\r\n- font-style.\r\n- font-variant.\r\n- font-weight.\r\n- line-height.\r\n22. Contextual selectors : -\r\n\r\nA contextual selector matches when an element is an arbitrary descendent of some ancestor element (i.e., it may be any generation below the ancestor element). A contextual selector is made up of two or more selectors separated by white space.\r\n\r\nContextual selectors allow the developer to select different types of styles for different parts of the document. In CSS, the developer can either specify styles directly or by making certain classes. The contextual selector will only apply the style to the elements which are specified.\r\n\r\n23. Css nomenclature : -\r\n\r\nThe CSS class naming convention defines rules for choosing the character sequences for naming a CSS class to reduce the effort needed to read and understand the code. There are various naming conventions, like using hyphen-delimited strings, BEM(Block-Element-Modifier), OOCSS(Object-oriented CSS), etc.\r\n\r\n- Naming Convention Basics.\r\n- Do Not Use Special Characters.\r\n- Do Not Use Any Spaces.\r\n- The Filename Should Start With a Letter.\r\n- Use All Lower Case.\r\n- Keep the Filename as Short as Possible.\r\n- The Most Important Part of Your CSS Filename.\r\n- CSS File-Naming Conventions.\r\n24. When should you use translate () instead of absolute positioning in\r\n\r\nCSS?\r\n\r\nUse translate() when you need to move an element without affecting the layout of other elements on the page. Consider using translate() instead of absolute positioning in scenarios such as animations, responsive design, and small adjustments to element positions.\r\n\r\n25. Position some aspect : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003cposition\u003e (or \u003cbg-position\u003e ) CSS data type denotes a two-dimensional coordinate used to set a location relative to an element box. It is used in the background-position and offset-anchor properties. Note: The final position described by the \u003cposition\u003e value does not need to be inside the element's box\r\n\r\n26. Mixins : -\r\n\r\nA mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. Here's an example for theme . SCSS.\r\n\r\nMixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet. They make it easy to avoid using non-semantic classes like .float-left , and to distribute collections of styles in libraries.\r\n\r\n27. How does browser work under the hood?\r\n\r\nEach browser has a browser engine under the hood. It works as a bridge between the user interface and the rendering engine. It queries and manipulates the rendering engine based on the input it gets from the user interface.\r\n\r\n28. Float : -\r\n\r\nThe float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning).\r\n\r\n29. Logical vs physical tag : -\r\n\r\na logical tag is a tag that describes the meaning or structure of the content it surrounds, while a physical tag describes the presentation or appearance of the content.\r\n\r\n30. Image scripts : -\r\n\r\nAn image sprite is a collection of images put into a single image. A web page with many images can take a long time to load and generates multiple server requests. Using image sprites will reduce the number of server requests and save bandwidth.\r\n\r\n31. Position static : -\r\n\r\nThe position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.\r\n\r\nThere are five different position values:\r\n\r\n- static\r\n- relative\r\n- fixed\r\n- absolute\r\n- sticky ●\r\n32. Attribute selectors : -\r\n\r\nThis type of attribute selector is used to select all the elements that have the specified attribute and applies the CSS property to that attribute. For example, the selector [class] will select all the elements with the style attribute\r\n\r\n33. Child selectors : -\r\n\r\nThe child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.\r\n\r\n34. Css framework : -\r\n\r\n**Top 5 CSS Frameworks for Developers and Designers**\r\n\r\n- Bootstrap.\r\n- Tailwind CSS.\r\n- Foundation.\r\n- Bulma.\r\n- Skeleton.\r\n35. Ruleset : -\r\n\r\nThe CSS Ruleset is used to apply a set of properties with some define values for the element or a specific set of elements that are used in the HTML page.\r\n\r\n36. Embedded style sheet : -\r\n\r\nIt allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. This is done by embedding the \u003cstyle\u003e\u003c/style\u003e tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document.\r\n\r\n37. Reset vs normalize css : -\r\n\r\nNormalizing retains the default styles that are useful and removes those that are not whereas the reset removes all the styles of the browser. In reset, we will have to re declare all the styles after resetting the browser whereas, normalizing will keep the required styles and only removes the unwanted ones\r\n\r\n38. Adaptive vs responsive desing : -\r\n\r\nA responsive design can change its layout and appearance based on the screen size of the device it's accessed on, from a large desktop computer to a small mobile phone. An adaptive design requires the creation of a different layout for each device the website will be accessed on\r\n\r\n39. Center a div : -\r\n\r\n.parent {\r\n\r\nbackground: gray; height: 300px; width: 300px; position: relative;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n.child {\r\n\r\nbackground-color: orange; position: absolute;\r\n\r\ntop: 50%;\r\n\r\nleft: 50%;\r\n\r\ntransform: translate(-50%,-50%);\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n40. Grid system : -\r\n\r\nThe CSS grid layout module excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives. Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows.\r\n\r\n41. Grid vs flex box : -\r\n\r\nThe basic difference between CSS grid layout and CSS flexbox layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.\r\n\r\n42. Progressive rendering : -\r\n\r\nIn progressive Rendering, the web page is divided into different parts on the basis of priority. So different parts will be rendered sequentially according to Server-Side Rendering and sent to the client side\r\n\r\n43. Reset.css file : -\r\n\r\nA CSS Reset file circumvents inconsistencies across different browsers when developing websites. All browsers have default rules with properties and values applied to all pages before loading files. Due to the cascading nature of CSS, any styles the browser uses will remain unless explicitly overridden\r\n\r\n44. Box model vs box sizing : -\r\n\r\nThe box model refers to the composition of elements on a page. When you specify the height or width of an element, you're setting the content size—any padding, border, and margin will be added to that. Applying box-sizing: border-box to an element changes the box model to a more predictable behavior.\r\n\r\n45. Css variables : -\r\n\r\nThe var() function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable.\r\n\r\nCSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that you can create variables with local or global scope, change the variables with JavaScript, and change the variables based on media queries.\r\n\r\nA good way to use CSS variables is when it comes to the colors of your design. Instead of copy and paste the same colors over and over again, you can place them in variables.\r\n\r\n46. Display property : -\r\n\r\nThe display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline box and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex. Formally, the display property sets an element's inner and outer display types.\r\n\r\n47. Direct child selectors and descendent child selector in css : -\r\n\r\n    The Child Combinator (\u003e) only selects those HTML Elements that are direct children of a specified element. While the Descendant Combinator selects all HTML Elements that are either children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and so on. They all are descendants of a specified element and thus all are selected.\r\n\r\n48. Margin vs padding : -\r\n\r\nIn CSS, a margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.\r\n\r\n49. Media breakpoint for responsive : -\r\n- Mobile devices – 320px — 480px.\r\n- iPads, Tablets – 481px — 768px.\r\n- Small screens, laptops – 769px — 1024px.\r\n- Desktops, large screens – 1025px — 1200px.\r\n- Extra large screens, TV – 1201px, and more.\r\n50. Bem methodology : -\r\n\r\nBEM is a front-end naming method for organizing and naming CSS classes. The Block, Element, Modifier methodology is a popular naming convention for class names in HTML and CSS\r\n\r\n51. Em vs rem : -\r\n\r\nBasically that both rem and em are scalable and relative units of size, but with em, the unit is relative to the font size of its parent element, while the rem unit is only relative to the root font size of the HTML document. The “r” in rem stands for “root”\r\n\r\n52. Specificity : -\r\n\r\nIf there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will \"win\", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.\r\n\r\n53. Diff b/w static,relative,absolute and fixed position : -\r\n\r\n    Static - this is the default value, all elements are in order as they appear in the document. Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position. Absolute - the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent. Fixed - the element is positioned related to the browser window.\r\n\r\n54. Gradient : -\r\n\r\nGradient Backgrounds. CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors. CSS defines three types of gradients: Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally) Radial Gradients (defined by their center)\r\n\r\n55. Calc () : -\r\n\r\nIt can be used to calculate length, percentage, time, number, integer frequency, or angle. It uses the four simple arithmetic operators add (+), multiply (\\*), subtract (-), and divide (/). It is a powerful CSS concept because it allows us to mix any units, such as percentage and pixel.\r\n\r\n56. Word wrap : -\r\n\r\nThe word-wrap property allows long words to be able to be broken and wrap onto the next line.\r\n\r\n57. Shadow effect : -\r\n\r\nWith CSS you can add shadow to text and to elements.\r\n\r\nh1 { text-shadow: 2px 2px;}\r\n\r\n58. Transition : -\r\n\r\nCSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.\r\n\r\n**THANK YOU**\r\n\r\n**(*AKKI)***\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"HTML-CSS-Interview"},"buildId":"zp6Cpz-VBs-8s_vSqyqjj","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script><div id="notifications"></div></body></html>
