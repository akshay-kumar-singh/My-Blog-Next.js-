You probably don't know it well enough!","image":"dsa.png","isFeatured":false,"date":"2024-08-21","content":"\r\n\r\n**1.what is java ?**\r\n\r\n**Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence, as code written in Java can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's designed to be portable, secure, and robust, making it widely used in various domains, including software development, web applications, mobile apps, and more.**\r\n\r\n**2.why java is not 100% object oriented ?**\r\n\r\n**Java is considered mostly object-oriented, but it's not entirely 100% object-oriented due to the following reasons:**\r\n\r\n**Primitive Data Types: Java includes primitive data types (int, double, boolean, etc.) that are not objects. These types do not inherit from a common class and don't have behavior or methods associated with them.**\r\n\r\n**Static Members: Java supports static methods and variables that belong to a class rather than to instances of the class. Static members are not associated with objects and can be accessed without object instantiation, deviating from pure object-oriented principles.**\r\n\r\n**These aspects introduce a level of deviation from complete object-oriented purity in Java. However, the language primarily follows object-oriented paradigms by emphasizing object creation, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.**\r\n\r\n**3.Why pointer are not used in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Pointers are not used in Java mainly for two reasons:**\r\n\r\n**Safety and Security: Pointers in languages like C and C++ allow direct memory manipulation, which can lead to issues like memory leaks, dangling pointers, and unauthorized access to memory locations. Java was designed to prioritize safety and security by implementing automatic memory management through the use of a garbage collector. Java's memory model abstracts pointers to prevent developers from directly accessing memory locations, reducing the likelihood of such errors.**\r\n\r\n**Platform Independence: Java aimed to be platform-independent by introducing the concept of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Using pointers could complicate the portability of Java programs across di\u0000erent platforms because pointers are highly dependent on the underlying hardware architecture. By abstracting pointers and memory management, Java ensures that programs can run consistently on any platform with a JVM without concerns about memory addresses or pointer sizes.**\r\n\r\n**4.what is JIT compiler in java ?**\r\n\r\n**A just-in-time (JIT) compiler is a program that turns bytecode into instructions that can be sent directly to a computer's processor (CPU). Typically, compilers are key in deciding the speed of an application for developers and end users.**\r\n\r\n**5.Why strings are immutable in Java?**\r\n\r\n**The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.**\r\n\r\n**6.what is a market interface in java ?**\r\n\r\n**A marker interface is an interface that doesn't have any methods or constants inside it. It provides run-time type information about objects, so the compiler and JVM have additional information about the object. A marker interface is also called a tagging interface.**\r\n\r\n**7.can you override a private or static method in java ?**\r\n\r\n**You cannot override a private or static method in Java. If you create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the super class method; this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in sub class because it's not accessible there.**\r\n\r\n**No, we cannot override static methods because method overriding is based on dynamic binding at runtime and the static methods are bonded using static binding at compile time.**\r\n\r\n**8.does finally always excute in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Yes, the finally block in Java always executes, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. It is used to clean up resources, such as closing files or database connections.**\r\n\r\n**9.what method does the object class have in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The Object class in Java is the root of the class hierarchy. All other classes in Java inherit directly or indirectly from the Object class. The Object class has several methods that are inherited by all other classes, including:**\r\n\r\n**toString() Method.**\r\n\r\n**hashCode() Method.**\r\n\r\n**equals(Object obj) Method.**\r\n\r\n**getClass() method.**\r\n\r\n**finalize() method.**\r\n\r\n**clone() method.**\r\n\r\n**wait(), notify() notifyAll() Methods.**\r\n\r\n**10.how can you make a class immutable in java ?**\r\n\r\n**To make a class immutable in Java, you need to follow these general principles: -Declare the class as final: so it can't be extended.**\r\n\r\n**-Make all of the fields private: so that direct access is not allowed.**\r\n\r\n**-Don't provide setter methods: for variables.**\r\n\r\n**-Make all mutable fields final: so that a field's value can be assigned only once. -Initialize all fields using a constructor method: performing deep copy. -Perform cloning of objects: in the getter methods to return a copy rather than returning the actual object reference.**\r\n\r\n**public final class ImmutableClass {**\r\n\r\n**private final int value;**\r\n\r\n**public ImmutableClass(int value) {**\r\n\r\n**this.value = value;**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**public int getValue() {**\r\n\r\n**return value;**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**11.what is singleton class in java and how can we make a class singleton ?**\r\n\r\n**A singleton class is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The singleton pattern is often used for resources such as database connections or configuration settings.**\r\n\r\n**There are many ways to implement a singleton class in Java. One common way is to use a private constructor and a static method to get the instance of the class.**\r\n\r\n**For example:**\r\n\r\n**public class Singleton {**\r\n\r\n**private static Singleton instance;**\r\n\r\n**private Singleton() {}**\r\n\r\n**public static Singleton getInstance() {**\r\n\r\n**if (instance == null) {**\r\n\r\n**instance = new Singleton();**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**return instance;**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n12. **What is a ClassLoader?**\r\n\r\n**A classloader in Java is a subsystem of Java Virtual Machine, dedicated to loading class files when a program is executed; ClassLoader is the first to load the executable file. Java has Bootstrap, Extension, and Application classloaders.**\r\n\r\n13. **what are the memory allocations available in java ?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, memory allocation refers to the process of setting aside virtual memory sections in a program to store variables and instances of classes and structures. The memory isn't allocated to an object at declaration time, but only a reference is created. The new() method is used to allocate memory to the object, so the object is always allocated memory on the heap.**\r\n\r\n**The Memory allocation in java is divided into parts, namely- Heap, Stack, Code, and Static.**\r\n\r\n14. **WILL THE PROGRAM RUN IF I WRITE STATIC PUBLIC VOID MAIN in java ?**\r\n\r\n**If you write static public void instead of public static void then it is perfectly OK. Your Java program will compile and run successfully. It doesn't really make any di\u0000erence as long as method name comes last and return type of method comes second last.**\r\n\r\n15. **what is default value stored in local variable in java ?**\r\n\r\n**There is no default value for local variables, so local variables should be declared and an initial value should be assigned before the first use.**\r\n\r\n16. **What is the Association?**\r\n\r\n**Association in Java is a connection or relation between two separate classes that are set up through their objects. Association relationship indicates how objects know each other and how they are using each other's functionality. It can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many.**\r\n\r\n17. **define copy constructor in java ?**\r\n\r\n**A copy constructor is a special type of constructor that allows you to create a new object that is an exact copy of an existing object. It is a very useful feature when you want to create a new object without having to manually copy all of the properties of the existing object.**\r\n\r\n**To define a copy constructor in Java, you simply need to create a constructor that takes the existing object as a parameter and then copies all of its properties to the new object.**\r\n\r\n**The following code shows an example of a copy constructor in Java: public class MyClass {**\r\n\r\n**private int x;**\r\n\r\n**private int y;**\r\n\r\n**public MyClass(int x, int y) {**\r\n\r\n**this.x = x;**\r\n\r\n**this.y = y;**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**// Copy constructor**\r\n\r\n**public MyClass(MyClass other) {**\r\n\r\n**this.x = other.x;**\r\n\r\n**this.y = other.y;**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n18. **what is a marker interface in java ?**\r\n\r\n**A marker interface is an interface that doesn't have any methods or constants inside it. It provides run-time type information about objects, so the compiler and JVM have additional information about the object. A marker interface is also called a tagging interface.**\r\n\r\n19. **what is object cloning in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Object cloning in Java is the process of creating an exact copy of an object. It is a way to create a duplicate of an object without a\u0000ecting the original object.**\r\n\r\n**To clone an object, you can use the clone() method. The clone() method is a protected method in the Object class. To use it, you must first declare the class as implementing the Cloneable interface.**\r\n\r\n**The following code shows how to clone an object: public class MyClass implements Cloneable {**\r\n\r\n**private int x; private String y;**\r\n\r\n**public MyClass(int x, String y) {**\r\n\r\n**this.x = x;**\r\n\r\n**this.y = y;**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**@Override**\r\n\r\n**public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {**\r\n\r\n**return super.clone();**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**20.What is meant by wrapper class in Java?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, a wrapper class is a class that wraps one or more primitive data types. Wrapper classes are very common in java. For example, String, Integer and Boolean are wrapper classes. Wrapper classes are used to treat primitive data types as objects.**\r\n\r\n21. **What is a package in Java?**\r\n\r\n**A Java package is a set of classes, interfaces, and sub-packages that are similar. In Java, it divides packages into two types: built-in packages and user-defined packages. Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API) and User-defined Packages are the two types of packages (create your own packages).**\r\n\r\n22. **What is the di\u0000erence between instance variables and local variables in Java?**\r\n\r\n**An instance variable is a variable that is declared in a class but outside a method while the local variable is a variable declared within a method or a constructor. Thus, this is the main di\u0000erence between instance variable and local variable.**\r\n\r\n23. **explain java string pool ?**\r\n\r\n**String pool is a storage space in the Java heap memory where string literals are stored. It is also known as String Constant Pool or String Intern Pool. It is privately maintained by the Java String class. By default, the String pool is empty.**\r\n\r\n24. **what is an exception in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Definition: An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it o\u0000 to the runtime system.**\r\n\r\n25. **What is the final keyword in java?**\r\n\r\n**The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override). The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...). The final keyword is called a \"modifier\".**\r\n\r\n26. **what happens when main isn't declared as static in java ?**\r\n\r\n**If the main method is not declared static, the JVM has to create an instance of the main Class, and because the constructor might be overloaded and include arguments, there will be no reliable and consistent way for the JVM to find the main method in Java.**\r\n\r\n27. **what is jdk? mention the variants of jdk in java .**\r\n\r\n**The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment that includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java compiler, and other development tools. It is used to develop Java applications and applets.**\r\n\r\n**The JDK is a collection of tools and libraries needed to develop Java applications. It includes the Java compiler, debugger, and other tools.**\r\n\r\n**Here are some of the most popular variants of the JDK:**\r\n\r\n**Oracle JDK**\r\n\r\n**OpenJDK**\r\n\r\n**IBM JDK**\r\n\r\n**Amazon Corretto**\r\n\r\n**Azul Platform Core (Zulu)**\r\n\r\n**Microsoft Build of OpenJDK**\r\n\r\n**SAPMachine**\r\n\r\n**Azul Platform Prime (Zing)**\r\n\r\n28. **brief access specifiers and its types in java :-**\r\n\r\n**Here are the access specifiers and their types in Java:**\r\n\r\n**Public:**\r\n\r\n**Public access specifiers are the most accessible type of access specifier. They can be accessed from anywhere in the program.**\r\n\r\n**Protected:**\r\n\r\n**Protected access specifiers are accessible within the same package and to subclasses in other packages.**\r\n\r\n**Private:**\r\n\r\n**Private access specifiers are the least accessible type of access specifier. They can only be accessed within the class in which they are declared.**\r\n\r\n**Default (Package-private):**\r\n\r\n**Default access specifiers are accessible within the same package. They cannot be accessed from outside the package.**\r\n\r\n29. **can a constructor return a value in java ?**\r\n\r\n**No, constructor does not return any value. While declaring a constructor you will not have anything like return type. In general, Constructor is implicitly called at the time of instantiation. And it is not a method, its sole purpose is to initialize the instance variables.**\r\n\r\n30. **What is this keyword in Java?**\r\n\r\n**The keyword 'this' in Java serves a fundamental purpose: it refers to the current object. In other words, 'this' represents the instance of the class where it's used. It's commonly used to access or modify the fields of the current object, especially when field names are the same as local variable names.**\r\n\r\n31. **What is method overloading and method overriding in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Definition: Method overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but di\u0000erent parameters within the same class, while method overriding involves creating a method in the child class that has the same name, parameters, and return type as a method in the parent class.**\r\n\r\n32. **Can We Overload Static Methods In Java?**\r\n\r\n**Yes, we can overload static methods in Java. Method overloading in Java allows us to have multiple methods with the same name in a class, but they must have di\u0000erent parameter lists.**\r\n\r\n33. **Late binding: -**\r\n\r\n**In the late binding or dynamic binding, the compiler doesn't decide the method to be called. Overriding is a perfect example of dynamic binding. In overriding both parent and child classes have the same method.**\r\n\r\n34. **What is a dynamic method dispatch in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Dynamic Method Dispatch in Java is the process by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime (during the code execution). The concept of method overriding is the way to attain runtime polymorphism in Java. During the code execution, JVM decides which implementation of the same method should be called.**\r\n\r\n35. **Why is the delete function faster in the linked list than an array?**\r\n\r\n**The delete function is generally faster in a linked list than in an array due to the di\u0000erence in data structure. In a linked list, deleting an element involves simply changing the references of the adjacent nodes to bypass the node being deleted.**\r\n\r\n**The insertion, addition, and removal operations are faster in a LinkedList because there is no resizing of an array done in the background. When a new item is added somewhere in the middle of the list, only references in surrounding elements need to change.**\r\n\r\n36. **The life cycle of a thread in Java consists of the following stages:**\r\n\r\n**-New: A thread is created but not yet started.**\r\n\r\n**-Runnable: A thread is ready to run, but the scheduler has not selected it to be the running thread.**\r\n\r\n**-Running: When the thread is executing its task.**\r\n\r\n**-Blocked: When the thread is waiting for some resource or lock.**\r\n\r\n**-Waiting: When the thread is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action without any time limit.**\r\n\r\n**-Timed Waiting: When the thread is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action for a specified interval of time.**\r\n\r\n**-Terminated: When the thread has completed its task or otherwise terminates.**\r\n\r\n37. **brief the life cycle of an applet in java : -**\r\n\r\n**The Applet Life Cycle in Java can be defined as the process of how an applet object is created, started, stopped, and destroyed during the entire execution of the applet.** **There are mainly five core methods used in the Applet Life Cycle in Java namely, init() start()**\r\n\r\n38. **Why are generics used in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Generics in Java are used to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with di\u0000erent types of data. This can help to improve code reusability and reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.**\r\n\r\n39. **Interface Externalizable: -**\r\n\r\n**The writeExternal and readExternal methods of the Externalizable interface are implemented by a class to give the class complete control over the format and contents of the stream for an object and its supertypes. These methods must explicitly coordinate with the supertype to save its state.**\r\n\r\n40. **What is Daemon Thread in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Daemon thread in Java is a low-priority thread that performs background operations such as garbage collection, finalizer, Action Listeners, Signal dispatches, etc. Daemon thread in Java is also a service provider thread that helps the user thread.**\r\n\r\n41. **enumeration in java : -**\r\n\r\n**Enum, introduced in Java 5, is a special data type that consists of a set of pre-defined named values separated by commas. These named values are also known as elements or enumerators or enum instances. Since the values in the enum type are constant, you should always represent them in UPPERCASE letters.**\r\n\r\n42. **why is java is dynamic in nature ?**\r\n\r\n**Java is considered a dynamic language because of its ability to adapt to changing environments and handle unexpected events at runtime. Some of the key features that contribute to Java's dynamic nature include:**\r\n\r\n43. **can you run a code before executing the main method ?**\r\n\r\n**No, main method is the entry point of a Java application. So basically, anything before main() execution is done internally by Java itself, so we explicitely can't hinder those processes. In Java code we use the main () method to start our code so that JVM will search for main () method and starts execution.**\r\n\r\n44. **how many times the finalize method called in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The finalize() method in Java is a method that is called by the garbage collector just before an object is garbage collected. It is a public method that is defined in the Object class. It is not guaranteed that the finalize() method will be called, and it is not recommended to rely on it for critical cleanup operations.**\r\n\r\n45. **can we use this and super together in java ?**\r\n\r\n**No, we cannot use the this() and super() in the same constructor. If we want to use this() or super() inside a constructor, they must be written (executed) at first. Both this() and super() cannot be executed simultaneously, hence “this()” and “super()” in Java cannot be used in the same constructor.**\r\n\r\n46. **What is JSP in Java with example?**\r\n\r\n**JavaServer Page (JSP) is Java's answer to the popular Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP). JSP, like ASP, provides a simplified and fast mean to generate dynamic web contents. It allows you to mix static HTML with dynamically generated HTML - in the way that the business logic and the presentation are well separated.**\r\n\r\n47. **JDBC : -**\r\n\r\n**JDBC is a Java database API that was created as an industry standard for making connections between Java applications and other databases. The Java JDBC connection in Java API defines all classes that handle various aspects of the database, such as connection details, result sets, and database metadata.**\r\n\r\n48. **What are the various directives in JSP?**\r\n\r\n**They provide commands or directions to the container on how to deal with and manage certain JSP processing portions. Directives can contain several attributes that** **are separated by a comma and act as key-value pairs. In JSP, directives are described with a pair of \u003c%@ .... %\u003e tags.**\r\n\r\n49. **What is observable and Observer in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Observer : Any object that wishes to be notified when the state of another object changes. Observable : Any object whose state may be of interest, and in whom another object may register an interest.**\r\n\r\n50. **what is session management in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Servlet Session Management is a mechanism in Java used by Web container to store session information. Session tracking is a way to manage the data of a user, this is known as session management in servlet. Session in Java are managed through di\u0000erent ways, such as, HTTP Session API, Cookies, URL rewriting, etc.**\r\n\r\n51. **brief about spring framework in java : -**\r\n\r\n**The Spring Framework is an open-source framework for building enterprise Java applications. Spring aims to simplify the complex and cumbersome enterprise Java application development process by o\u0000ering a framework that includes technologies such as: Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) Dependency injection (DI).**\r\n\r\n52. **What is the JCA program in Java?**\r\n\r\n**The Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) is a robust set of APIs that provide essential cryptographic functionality for the Java programming language. It is used in various applications, including secure communications, digital signatures, key management, and password authentication.**\r\n\r\n53. **What is meant by JPA in Java?**\r\n\r\n**JPA stands for Java Persistence API. It is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that allows us to map Java objects to tables in a relational database.**\r\n\r\n54. **explain the di\u0000erent authentication in java servlets : - There are four types of authentication available in Servlets:**\r\n1. **HTTP Basic Authentication:**\r\n\r\n**This is the least secure type of authentication. In this, the server uses the username and password provided by the client and these credentials are transmitted using simple base64 encoding.**\r\n\r\n2. **HTTP Digest Authentication:**\r\n\r\n**This is similar to Basic Authentication, but with an additional precaution to prevent a third party from doing eavesdrop on the http packets and easily read the username and password.**\r\n\r\n3. **HTTPS Client Authentication:**\r\n\r\n**This is a more secure method of authentication than either basic or form-based authentication. It uses HTTP over SSL, in which the server and, optionally, the client authenticate one another using public key certificates.**\r\n\r\n4. **Form-based Authentication:**\r\n\r\n**This is the most secure type of authentication. In this, the user is presented with a login form where they enter their username and password. These credentials are then sent to the server for authentication.**\r\n\r\n55. **how is a java program executed ?**\r\n\r\n**The Java compiler takes the source code and produces bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The bytecode is loaded into the JVM, and the JVM interprets the bytecode and executes the program. The code cannot be compiled because of compilation errors. Debugging is mainly done in run-time.**\r\n\r\n56. **How is java platform independent ?**\r\n\r\n**Java is platform-independent because it is compiled to a bytecode that can be run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that you can write a Java program on one platform (such as Windows) and then run it on a di\u0000erent platform (such as macOS or Linux) without making any changes to the code.**\r\n\r\n57. **What are Methods in Java?**\r\n\r\n**A method in Java is a block of code that, when called, performs specific actions mentioned in it. For instance, if you have written instructions to draw a circle in the method, it will do that task. You can insert values or parameters into methods, and they will only be executed when called.**\r\n\r\n58. **what is java main method ?**\r\n\r\n**The Java main method is usually the first method you learn about when you start programming in Java because its the entry point for executing a Java program. The main method can contain code to execute or call other methods, and it can be placed in any class that's part of a program.**\r\n\r\n59. **what is (string args) that always appeared on the java main method ? String[]args in Java, i.e., a command line argument array, is used in Java to retrieve input from the console. It is worth noting that, You can access the String args in Java only in static blocks, such as Main. The rest of your system, including any non-static objects, cannot access it.**\r\n59. **what is a static method ?**\r\n\r\n    **A static method (or static function) is a method defined as a member of an object but is accessible directly from an API object's constructor, rather than from an object instance created via the constructor.**\r\n\r\n61. **can we overload the main method in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Yes, we can overload the main() method in Java. A Java class can have any number of overloaded main() methods. But the very first thing JVM (Java Virtual Machine) seeks is the original main() method, i.e., public static void main(String[] args) to execute.**\r\n\r\n62. **what is constructor in java ?**\r\n\r\n**A constructor in Java Programming is a block of code that initializes (constructs) the state and value during object creation. It is called every time an object with the help of a new () keyword is created. Even if you haven't specified any constructor in the code, the Java compiler calls a default constructor.**\r\n\r\n63. **Types of Constructor in Java Default Constructor.**\r\n\r\n    **No-Args constructor. Parameterized constructor.**\r\n\r\n64. **What is the main di\u0000erence between a Constructor and a Method?**\r\n\r\n**A constructor helps in initializing an object, has no return type and cannot be inherited by subclasses. On the other hand, a method executes operations, returns a value, and can be inherited by subclasses.**\r\n\r\n65. **what is inheritance in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system). The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.**\r\n\r\n**In Java, inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword.**\r\n\r\n66. **What is superclass and subclass in Java with example?**\r\n\r\n**Subclasses, Superclasses, and Inheritance**\r\n\r\n**In Java, as in other object-oriented programming languages, classes can be derived from other classes. The derived class (the class that is derived from another class) is called a subclass. The class from which its derived is called the superclass. In fact, in Java, all classes must be derived from some class.**\r\n\r\n67. **what is final variable in java ?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, the final keyword is used to denote constants. It can be used with variables, methods, and classes. Once any entity (variable, method or class) is declared final , it can be assigned only once. That is, the final variable cannot be reinitialized with another value.**\r\n\r\n68. **what are abstract classes in java ?**\r\n\r\n**An abstract class**\r\n\r\n**is a class that cannot be instantiated. It can only be subclassed. Abstract**\r\n\r\n**classes are used to provide a common set of methods and variables for subclasses. To create an abstract class, you use the abstract keyword.**\r\n\r\n69. **what is the di\u0000erence between jdk,jre and jvm ?**\r\n\r\n**Here are some di\u0000erences between JDK, JRE, and JVM:**\r\n\r\n**JDK:**\r\n\r\n**A software development kit that contains tools for developing, monitoring, and debugging Java code. JDK is primarily used for code execution and development. JRE:**\r\n\r\n**A software bundle that allows Java programs to run. JRE is a set of software tools designed for running other software. JRE contains class libraries and other supporting files required by JVM for executing Java programs.**\r\n\r\n**JVM:**\r\n\r\n**An environment for executing bytecode.**\r\n\r\n70. **how many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM ?**\r\n\r\n**The Java virtual machine memory area is a runtime area that is used for the execution of various programs involved during runtime of a java application, the memory area of JVM is broadly divided into five di\u0000erent parts which are method area, heap area, Stack, Program counter (PC) registers area and Native method area ..**\r\n\r\n71. **why is main method static in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The main() method is declared static so that JVM can call it without creating an instance of the class containing the main() method. We must declare the main() function static as no class object is present when the java runtime starts. JVM can then load the class into the main memory and invoke the main() method.**\r\n\r\n72. **how is exception handling implemented in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The try-catch is the simplest method of handling exceptions. Put the code you want to run in the try block, and any Java exceptions that the code throws are caught by one or more catch blocks. This method will catch any type of Java exceptions that get thrown. This is the simplest mechanism for handling exceptions.**\r\n\r\n73. **can you catch multiple exception in a single catch block in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Yes, you can catch multiple exceptions in a single catch block in Java. This feature was introduced in Java 7. To do this, you can use the pipe (|) symbol to separate the exception types that you want to catch in the catch block.**\r\n\r\n74. **what are the principles of object oriented programming in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The main ideas behind Java's Object-Oriented Programming, OOP concepts include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Basically, Java OOP concepts let us create working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of them without compromising security.**\r\n\r\n75. **what are di\u0000erence between abstract class and interface in java ?**\r\n\r\n**An abstract class comes with non-final variables. A Java interface comes with variables declared final by default. An abstract class in Java includes final, non-final, static, and non-static variables. An interface in Java comes with static and final variables.**\r\n\r\n76. **what are the use of static keyword in java ?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, static keyword is mainly used for memory management. It can be used with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. It is a keyword which is used to share the same variable or method of a given class. Basically, static is used for a constant variable or a method that is same for every instance of a class.**\r\n\r\n77. **what are the use of final keyword in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override). The final** **keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...). The final keyword is called a \"modifier\".**\r\n\r\n78. **what are the di\u0000erence between string, stringbuilder and stringbu\u0000er in java ? String is immutable whereas StringBu\u0000er and StringBuilder are mutable classes. StringBu\u0000er is thread-safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not. That's why StringBuilder is faster than StringBu\u0000er.**\r\n78. **what is the di\u0000erence between == and .equals() method in java ?**\r\n\r\n    **Conclusion: So, the main di\u0000erence between \"==\" and \"equals\" in Java is that \"==\" compares the memory location of two objects, while \"equals\" compares the contents of two objects.**\r\n\r\n80. **What is OOPs Concept?**\r\n\r\n**Object-oriented programming is a core of Java Programming, which is used for designing a program using classes and objects. OOPs, can also be characterized as data controlling for accessing the code.**\r\n\r\n**-inheritance**\r\n\r\n**-encapsulation**\r\n\r\n**-polymorphism**\r\n\r\n**-abstraction**\r\n\r\n81. **what is class and object in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors – wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class. Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.**\r\n\r\n82. **what is inheritance in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented** **programming system). The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.**\r\n\r\n83. **Types of Inheritance in Java : Single Inheritance.**\r\n\r\n    **Multi-Level Inheritance. Hierarchical Inheritance.**\r\n\r\n    **Hybrid Inheritance.**\r\n\r\n    **\\*Multiple Inheritance.**\r\n\r\n84. **what is polymorphism in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Polymorphism in Java is the task that performs a single action in di\u0000erent ways. So, languages that do not support polymorphism are not 'Object-Oriented Languages', but 'Object-Based Languages'. Ada, for instance, is one such language. Since Java supports polymorphism, it is an Object-Oriented Language.**\r\n\r\n85. **what is encapsulation in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Encapsulation in Java is the process by which data (variables) and the code that acts upon them (methods) are integrated as a single unit. By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes cannot access them, and only the methods of the class can access them.**\r\n\r\n86. **what is encapsulation in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Encapsulation in Java is the process by which data (variables) and the code that acts upon them (methods) are integrated as a single unit. By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes cannot access them, and only the methods of the class can access them.**\r\n\r\n87. **what is abstraction in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Abstraction in Java is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user and showing only the functionality to the user. It can be achieved by using abstract** **classes, methods, and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be inherited by concrete classes.**\r\n\r\n89. **public static void main(String[] args) method: -**\r\n\r\n**public: This means that the main method is accessible from anywhere in the program. static: This means that the main method does not belong to any particular object. It is a class method.**\r\n\r\n**void: This means that the main method does not return any value.**\r\n\r\n**main: This is the name of the method.**\r\n\r\n**String[] args: This is an array of strings that can be passed to the main method from the command line.**\r\n\r\n90. **What are the 8 primitive data types in Java?**\r\n\r\n**There are eight built-in primitive data types in Java. They are int, char, byte, short, long, float, double, and boolean.**\r\n\r\n91. **What is an exception in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Definition: An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.**\r\n\r\n92. **How to make object eligible for Garbage Collection ? Garbage Collection in Java-**\r\n\r\n    **Ways to make an object eligible for garbage collection in Java- By nullifying the reference variable-**\r\n\r\n    **By reassigning the reference variable-**\r\n\r\n    **By creating objects inside a method-**\r\n\r\n    **Island of Isolation-**\r\n\r\n93. **what is meant by java package ?**\r\n\r\n**A set of classes and interfaces grouped together are known as Packages in JAVA. The name itself defines that pack (group) of related types such as classes, sub-packages,** **enumeration, annotations, and interfaces that provide name-space management. Every class is a part of a certain package.**\r\n\r\n94. **what is user defined method in java ?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, a user-defined method is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called by other parts of the program. It is a way to modularize code and break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces.**\r\n\r\n95. **What is a NullPointerException in Java?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, a NullPointerException occurs when a variable that is being accessed has not yet been assigned to an object, in other words, the variable is assigned as null.**\r\n\r\n96. **what are jar files in java ?**\r\n\r\n**A JAR file, or Java Archive file, is a file format that is used to aggregate many files into one. It is a package file format that is typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution. JAR files are archive files that include a Java-specific manifest file.**\r\n\r\n**JAR files are used to store and distribute Java programs and libraries. They can also be used to store other types of files, such as configuration files and documentation.**\r\n\r\n97. **di\u0000erence between stack and heap memory in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) manages memory in two di\u0000erent areas: the stack and the heap. The stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure that is used to store local variables, method parameters, and return addresses. The heap is a free-form region of memory that is used to store object instances.**\r\n\r\n**The stack is a limited resource, and the JVM will throw a StackOverflowError if a method call causes the stack to overflow. The heap is not limited in size, but the JVM will throw an OutOfMemoryError if there is not enough free memory to allocate an object.**\r\n\r\n98. **what is lambda expression in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Lambda Expressions were added in Java 8. A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.**\r\n\r\n99. **what is functional interface in java ?**\r\n\r\n**An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as functional interface. It can have any number of default, static methods but can contain only one abstract method. It can also declare methods of object class. Functional Interface is also known as Single Abstract Method Interfaces or SAM Interfaces.**\r\n\r\n**100. what is method reference in java 8 ?**\r\n\r\n**Method reference is a new feature introduced in Java 8. It is a compact and easy form of the lambda expression. Method references are a special type of lambda expression. It is used to refer to a method of a functional interface.**\r\n\r\n**There are three types of method references in Java:**\r\n\r\n**-Reference to a static method**\r\n\r\n**-Reference to an instance method of a particular object**\r\n\r\n**-Reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type**\r\n\r\n**101. Why do we use optional in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Optional can help to prevent NullPointerException errors by making it explicit when a variable may or may not contain a value. This can lead to cleaner and more readable code. Optional provides several methods that can be used to safely work with data that may or may not be present.**\r\n\r\n**102. why stream api is required in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The Stream API is a powerful, but simple to understand set of tools for processing the sequence of elements.

Enable us to perform operations like filtering, mapping,reducing and sorting.**\r\n\r\n**103. what is collectors in java 8 ?**\r\n\r\n**A Collector is specified by four functions that work together to accumulate entries into a mutable result container, and optionally perform a final transform on the result. They are: creation of a new result container ( supplier() ) incorporating a new data element into a result container ( accumulator() )**\r\n\r\n**Java Stream collect() performs a mutable reduction operation on the elements of the stream. This is a terminal operation.**\r\n\r\n**104. what is the di\u0000erence between map and flatmap in java ?**\r\n\r\n**flatMap() is combination of a map() and a flattening operation. However, the di\u0000erence between map and flatmap is that flatmap() maps one input value multiple output values while map() maps to one value. flatMap() is an intermediate operation and return a new Stream or Optional.**\r\n\r\n**105.what is default method in interface in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Default methods enable you to add new functionality to existing interfaces and ensure binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces. In particular, default methods enable you to add methods that accept lambda expressions as parameters to existing interfaces.**\r\n\r\n**106. What does filter method return in Java 8?**\r\n\r\n**Java stream provides a method filter() to filter stream elements on the basis of given predicate. Suppose you want to get only even elements of your list then you can do this easily with the help of filter method. This method takes predicate as an argument and returns a stream of consisting of resulted elements.**\r\n\r\n**107. What are the core API classes for date and time in Java 8? Java 8 Date Time API Classes Examples**\r\n\r\n**LocalDate. LocalDate is an immutable class that represents Date with default format of yyyy-MM-dd. ...**\r\n\r\n**LocalTime. LocalTime is an immutable class whose instance represents a time in the human readable format. ...**\r\n\r\n**LocalDateTime. ...**\r\n\r\n**Instant.**\r\n\r\n**108.

But from Java 8, we can have default methods and static methods in the interfaces.**\r\n\r\n**109. what is a consumer in java 8 ?**\r\n\r\n**A Consumer is an in-built functional interface in the java.util.function package. It was introduced in Java 8. We use consumers when we need to consume objects, the consumer takes an input value and returns nothing. The consumer interface has two methods:**\r\n\r\n**void accept(T value);**\r\n\r\n**default Consumer\u003cT\u003e andThen(Consumer\u003c? super T\u003e after);**\r\n\r\n**A Consumer is a functional interface that accepts a single input and returns no output. It can be used in all contexts where an object needs to be consumed, i.e. taken as input, and some operation is to be performed on the object without returning any result.**\r\n\r\n**110. what are some terminal operation example java 8 ?**\r\n\r\n**Terminal Operations: noneMatch, allMatch, collect, findAny, findFirst, anyMatch, toArray, reduce, min, max, forEach, collect, count etc.**\r\n\r\n**111. How to remove duplicates from list in Java 8?**\r\n\r\n**To remove duplicates from a list in Java, you can use a Set data structure. Sets only allow unique elements, so by adding the list to a Set, duplicates will automatically be removed.**\r\n\r\n**112. di\u0000erence between collection API and Strean API ?**\r\n\r\n**A collection is an in-memory data structure, which holds all the values that the data structure currently has—every element in the collection has to be computed before it can be added to the collection. In contrast, a stream is a conceptually fixed data structure in which elements are computed on demand.**\r\n\r\n**113. What is meant by wrapper class in Java?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, a wrapper class is a class that wraps one or more primitive data types. Wrapper classes are very common in java. For example, String, Integer and Boolean are wrapper classes. Wrapper classes are used to treat primitive data types as objects.**\r\n\r\n**114. What is the purpose of final finally and finalize in Java?**\r\n\r\n**final is a keyword used in Java to restrict the modification of a variable, method, or class. finally is a block used in Java to ensure that a section of code is always executed, even if an exception is thrown. finalize is a method in Java used to perform cleanup processing on an object before it is garbage collected.**\r\n\r\n**115. what is the di\u0000erence between arraylist and vector in java ?**\r\n\r\n**ArrayList is unsynchronized and not thread-safe, whereas Vectors are. Only one thread can call methods on a Vector, which is slightly overhead but helpful when safety is a concern. Therefore, in a single-threaded case, ArrayList is the obvious choice, but where multithreading is concerned, vectors are often preferable.**\r\n\r\n**116. what is the di\u0000erence between hashmap and hashtable in java ?**\r\n\r\n**HashMap allows one null key and values can be null whereas HashTable doesn't allow null key or value. HashMap is faster than HashTable. HashMap iterator is fail-safe where HashTable iterator is not fail-safe. HashMap extends AbstractMap class where HashTable extends Dictionary class.**\r\n\r\n**117. what is runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Runtime polymorphism, also known as the Dynamic Method Dispatch, is a process that resolves a call to an overridden method at runtime. The process involves the use of the reference variable of a superclass to call for an overridden method.**\r\n\r\n**118. can you override a private or static method in java ?**\r\n\r\n**You cannot override a private or static method in Java. If you create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the super class method; this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in sub class because it's not accessible there.**\r\n\r\n**119. what is multiple inheritance and does java support ?**\r\n\r\n**Multiple inheritance in java is the capability of creating a single class with multiple superclasses. Unlike some other popular object oriented programming languages like C++, java doesn't provide support for multiple inheritance in classes.**\r\n\r\n**120. What is the di\u0000erence between GET and POST in Java HTTP?**\r\n\r\n**Data is transmitted in the header in HTTP GET. In HTTP POST, data is transmitted in the body. HTTP GET is less secure as details are visible in the URL bar. HTTP POST is more secure as details are not displayed in the URL bar.. what is di\u0000erence between**\r\n\r\n**get and post method in java?**\r\n\r\n**121. what is multithreading in java?**\r\n\r\n**Multithreading is a programming concept in which the application can create a small unit of tasks to execute in parallel. If you are working on a computer, it runs multiple applications and allocates processing power to them. A simple program runs in sequence and the code statements execute one by one.**\r\n\r\n**122. What is a Thread in Java?**\r\n\r\n**A thread in Java is the direction or path that is taken while a program is being executed. Generally, all the programs have at least one thread, known as the main** **thread, that is provided by the JVM or Java Virtual Machine at the starting of the program's execution.**\r\n\r\n**123. What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java with example? Threads in Java can be created in two fundamental ways: by extending the Thread class or by implementing the Runnable interface.**\r\n\r\n**124. how many types of thread are there in java ?**\r\n\r\n**two types**\r\n\r\n**There are two types of threads in an application - user thread and daemon thread. When we start an application, the main is the first user thread created. We can create multiple user threads as well as daemon threads. When all the user threads are executed, JVM terminates the program.**\r\n\r\n**125. what are the di\u0000erence between throw and throws in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly. It can throw only one exception at a time. The throws keyword can be used to declare multiple exceptions, separated by a comma. Whichever exception occurs, if matched with the declared ones, is thrown automatically then.**\r\n\r\nTHANK-YOU\r\n\r\n**DSA![](Aspose.Words.979eb78e-0cd3-4766-8e80-368a2a256874.001.png)**\r\n\r\n**1. What are data structures primarily used explain?**\r\n\r\n**Data Structures are the main part of many Computer Science Algorithms as they allow the programmers to manage the data in an effective way. It plays a crucial role in improving the performance of a program or software, as the main objective of the software is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible.**\r\n\r\n**2.What is the difference between the terms null and void?**\r\n\r\n**The difference between null and void as term for nothing stems from their place in physical space. A void is nothing but takes up space; null is nothing at all. In other words, you could measure a void but null offers nothing to measure. 4.1Void is used to indicate that a function/method does not return any data type.**\r\n\r\n3. **What is meant by dynamic memory management?**\r\n\r\n**Dynamic Memory Management is the process of allocating and deallocating blocks of memory during runtime. It is a critical aspect of programming in C and C++, where memory allocation is done dynamically.**\r\n\r\n4. **what are push and pop operation in data structure ? push :Adds an element to the top of the stack.**\r\n\r\n   **pop :Removes the topmost element from the stack. isEmpty :Checks whether the stack is empty.**\r\n\r\n   **isFull :Checks whether the stack is full.**\r\n\r\n   **top :Displays the topmost element of the stack.**\r\n\r\n5. **How is a variable stored in memory data structure?**\r\n\r\n**It is called stack memory allocation as the allocation happens in the function call stack. At the time of allocation, the memory size is known to the compiler and when there is a function call that happens, then its variable gets memory allocated on the stack.**\r\n\r\n6. **what is meaning of data abstraction ?**\r\n\r\n**Data abstraction is the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole. Abstraction, in general, is the process of removing characteristics from something to reduce it to a set of essential elements.**\r\n\r\n7. **what is the meaning of a postfix expression in data structure ?**\r\n\r\n**If we move the operators after the operands then it is known as a postfix expression. In other words, postfix expression can be defined as an expression in which all the** **operators are present after the operands. For example:If the infix expression is A + B \\* C.**\r\n\r\n8. **What is signed number and unsigned number?**\r\n\r\n**An unsigned number contains just zero or positive values, whereas a signed number**\r\n\r\n**has both positive and negative numbers along with the value zero. The maximum value of signed numbers is half that of unsigned numbers. Combining signed and unsigned numbers might cause complications.**\r\n\r\n9. **what data structure make use of pointers ?**\r\n\r\n**Linked lists, trees, graphs, and more are made possible through pointers. Linked lists consist of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence, forming a dynamic chain of elements. Trees utilize pointers to establish hierarchical relationships between parent and child nodes.**\r\n\r\n10. **What is Dynamic Data Structure?**\r\n\r\n**In Dynamic data structure the size of the structure is not fixed and can be modified during the operations performed on it. Dynamic data structures are designed to facilitate change of data structures in the run time.**\r\n\r\n11. **pointer allocate memory for data storage . true or false ?**\r\n\r\n**Yes, in some programming languages, memory can be allocated specifically for storing pointers. Pointers are variables that store memory addresses of other variables.**\r\n\r\n**12.What is difference between linear and nonlinear data structure?**\r\n\r\n**In a linear data structure, the data elements connect to each other sequentially. A user can transverse each element through a single run. In a non-linear data structure, the data elements connect to each other hierarchically.**\r\n\r\n13. **what is the use of void pointer in DSA ?**\r\n\r\n**As the name suggests, the void pointer indicates that the pointer is basically empty- and thus, it is capable of holding any data type address in the program. Then, these void pointers that have addresses, can be further typecast into other data types very easily.**\r\n\r\n14. **what is the meaning of stack overflow condition ?**\r\n\r\n**Overflow condition:When stack is completely full (i.e. TOP= MaxSize -1) and we try to insert more element onto stack then this condition is called overflow condition and no further element could be inserted now until any element is deleted.**\r\n\r\n15. **list the operations you can perform on data structure :-**\r\n\r\n**Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Sorting, and Merging are some operations that can be performed on a linear data structure. Stack and queue are two examples of linear data structures.**\r\n\r\n16. **how do signed and unsigned numbers affect memory ?**\r\n\r\n**The sign takes up 1bit of memory that could otherwise be used to represent a value. For example, a byte has 8 bits, all of which can be used to store an unsigned number from 0 to 255. You can store a signed number in the range of 128 to +127.**\r\n\r\n17. **difference between static and dynamic memory allocation ?**\r\n\r\n**In static memory allocation, while executing a program, the memory cannot be changed. In dynamic memory allocation, while executing a program, the memory can be changed. Static memory allocation is preferred in an array. Dynamic memory allocation is preferred in the linked list.**\r\n\r\n18. **explain the role of malloc , calloc , realloc and free in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Here are the roles of these functions:**\r\n\r\n**malloc():**\r\n\r\n**Allocates memory. It requires one argument for the total memory size and leaves it uninitialized.**\r\n\r\n**calloc():**\r\n\r\n**Allocates and initializes memory. It needs two arguments:the number of elements and their size, and it initializes the memory to zero.**\r\n\r\n**realloc():**\r\n\r\n**Adjusts the size of the dynamically allocated memory.**\r\n\r\n**free():**\r\n\r\n**Deallocates a memory block. It is used to manually free the memory allocated at run-time. The free() function takes a pointer and frees the memory the pointer is pointing towards.**\r\n\r\n19. **difference between storage and file structure ?**\r\n\r\n**Storage Structure:In this type, data is stored in the main memory i.e RAM, and is deleted once the function that uses this data gets completely executed. The difference is that storage structure has data stored in the memory of the computer system, whereas file structure has the data stored in the auxiliary memory.**\r\n\r\n20. **What is the difference between recursion and iteration?**\r\n\r\n**Recursion is a technique in which the function calls itself in its body to solve the problem, typically breaking into smaller and more manageable sub-problems. In contrast, Iteration is a technique that repetitively executes a code block until the condition is unmet.**\r\n\r\n21. **Do all declaration statements result in a fixed memory reservation?**\r\n\r\n**Except for pointers, all declaration statements result in a fixed memory reservation. Instead of allocating memory for storing data, a pointer declaration results in allocating memory for storing the address of the pointer variable.**\r\n\r\n22. **what is infix prefix and postfix in data structure ?**\r\n\r\n**The infix notation uses parentheses for function arguments, while the prefix and postfix notations can use other delimiters. The infix notation is the most usual** **notation for writing mathematical expressions, while the prefix and postfix notations are appropriate for particular applications.**\r\n\r\n23. **which data structures are used for implementing lru cache ?**\r\n\r\n**To implement an LRU cache, you can use two data structures:a hashmap and a doubly linked list.**\r\n\r\n**Here's what each data structure does:**\r\n\r\n**Doubly linked list**\r\n\r\n**Helps maintain the eviction order. The most recently used item is at the head of the list, and the least recently used item is at the tail.**\r\n\r\n**Hashmap**\r\n\r\n**Helps with O(1) lookup of cached keys. It also achieves constant-time access to any item in the cache.**\r\n\r\n24. **What do you mean by array?**\r\n\r\n**Overview. An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. Depending on the language, array types may overlap (or be identified with) other data types that describe aggregates of values, such as lists and strings.**\r\n\r\n25. **what are multi-dimensional array ?**\r\n\r\n**A multi-dimensional array is an array with more than one level or dimension. For example, a 2D array, or two-dimensional array, is an array of arrays, meaning it is a matrix of rows and columns (think of a table). A 3D array adds another dimension, turning it into an array of arrays of arrays.**\r\n\r\n26. **What do you mean by linked list?**\r\n\r\n**A linked list is the most sought-after data structure when it comes to handling dynamic data elements. A linked list consists of a data element known as a node. And each node consists of two fields:one field has data, and in the second field, the node has an address that keeps a reference to the next node.**\r\n\r\n27. **are linked lists considered linear or non-linear data structures ?**\r\n\r\n**A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous location. Instead the elements are linked using pointers. In a linked list data is stored in nodes and each node is linked to the next and, optionally, to the previous.**\r\n\r\n28. **where are multi-linked data structures used ?**\r\n\r\n**Multi-level linked lists can be used in a variety of applications, such as:Hierarchical data representation:Multi-level linked lists can be used to represent hierarchical data structures, such as a file system where files and folders are organized in a tree-like structure.**\r\n\r\n29. **what are the advantage of linked list over array ?**\r\n\r\n**In short, there are several advantages of linked list over arrays, such as dynamic size, efficient insertion and deletion, memory efficiency, easy implementation of abstract data types, and more efficient sorting in some cases.**\r\n\r\n30. **what is a doubly linked list ? what are its advantages over singly linked list ?**\r\n\r\n**The singly linked list can be traversed only in the forward direction. The doubly linked list can be accessed in both directions. It requires only one list pointer variable, i.e.,**\r\n\r\n**the head pointer pointing to the first node. It requires two list pointer variables, head and last.**\r\n\r\n31. **Linked lists have many applications :- Memory management**\r\n\r\n    **Data structure implementation**\r\n\r\n    **File system representation**\r\n\r\n    **Graph and chart representation**\r\n\r\n    **Music playlist building**\r\n\r\n    **Polynomial manipulation**\r\n\r\n    **Arithmetic operations on long integers**\r\n\r\n    **Sparse matrix representation Graph algorithm implementation Symbol table creation**\r\n\r\n    **Mailing list**\r\n\r\n    **Linked file allocation**\r\n\r\n32. **what are the difference between array and linked list ?**\r\n\r\n**An array is a grouping of data elements of equivalent data type. A linked list is a group of entities called a node. The node includes two segments:data and address.**\r\n\r\n33. **what are the applications of doubly linked list ?**\r\n\r\n**Here are some of the applications of doubly linked lists:**\r\n\r\n**Undo/redo functionality:**\r\n\r\n**Doubly linked lists are often used to implement undo/redo functionality in applications. This is because they allow for efficient tracking of changes to data, making it easy to revert to previous states.**\r\n\r\n**Browsing history:**\r\n\r\n**Many web browsers use doubly linked lists to store the browsing history of users. This allows users to easily navigate back to previous pages they have visited.**\r\n\r\n**Cache management:**\r\n\r\n**Doubly linked lists can be used to implement cache management algorithms, such as LRU (least recently used) and MRU (most recently used). These algorithms keep track of the most recently accessed items in a cache, and prioritize them for future access. Stacks and queues:**\r\n\r\n**Doubly linked lists can be used to implement stacks and queues. Stacks are a type of data structure that follows the LIFO (last in, first out) principle, while queues follow the FIFO (first in, first out) principle.**\r\n\r\n**Trees and graphs:**\r\n\r\n**Doubly linked lists can be used to represent trees and graphs. Trees are a hierarchical data structure, while graphs are a network of nodes connected by edges.**\r\n\r\n34. **how do you search for a target key in a linked list ?**\r\n\r\n**To find a target key in a linked list, you can use sequential search: -Start at the head or tail of the linked list.**\r\n\r\n**-Traverse the list one node at a time.**\r\n\r\n**-Compare the data of each node with the target element.**\r\n\r\n**-If the node is different, follow the link to the next node. -Continue until the target key is found or the last node is reached.**\r\n\r\n**You can also use the indexOf() and lastIndexOf() methods to search for an element in a linked list in Java.**\r\n\r\n35. **How do you know if a linked list has a loop?**\r\n\r\n**You can make use of Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, also known as tortoise and hare algorithm. The idea is to have two references to the list and move them at different speeds. Move one forward by 1node and the other by 2 nodes. If the linked list has a loop they will definitely meet.**\r\n\r\n36. **what are the types of searching used in data structure ?**\r\n\r\n**The two main types of searching in data structure are sequential/linear search, where each element is checked sequentially, and binary search, which is faster and works by dividing the dataset in half and comparing the middle element with the target value until a match is found.**\r\n\r\n37. **how does binary search work ?**\r\n\r\n**Binary search is an algorithm that finds an item in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. It works efficiently on sorted data, regardless of the data's size.**\r\n\r\n**Here are the steps of a binary search algorithm:**\r\n\r\n**-Read the search element from the user**\r\n\r\n**-Find the middle element in the sorted list**\r\n\r\n**-Compare the search element with the middle element in the sorted list**\r\n\r\n**-If both are matched, display \"Given element is found!!!\"and terminate the function If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned. If the target value is less than the element, the search continues in the lower half of the array.**\r\n\r\n38. **what are the minimum nodes binary trees can have ?**\r\n\r\n**If binary tree has height h, minimum number of nodes is h+1(in case of left skewed and right skewed binary tree). For example, the binary tree shown in Figure 2(a) with height 2 has 3 nodes. If binary tree has height h, maximum number of nodes will be when all levels are completely full.**\r\n\r\n39. **what are the data structure that are used in dfs and bfs algorithm ?**\r\n\r\n**DFS is an abbreviation of Depth First Search. BFS (Breadth First Search) finds the shortest path using the Queue data structure. DFS (Depth First Search) makes use of the Stack data structure.**\r\n\r\n40. **what are the time complexity of linear search and binary search ?**\r\n\r\n**Linear Search has a time complexity of O(n), while Binary Search has a time complexity of O(log n).**\r\n\r\n41. **What does DFS mean in algorithm?**\r\n\r\n**Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for searching a graph or tree data structure. The algorithm starts at the root (top) node of a tree and goes as far as it can down a given branch (path), then backtracks until it finds an unexplored path, and then explores it.**\r\n\r\n42. **What is the BFS algorithm?**\r\n\r\n**BFS is a traversing algorithm where you should start traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) and traverse the graph layerwise thus exploring the neighbour nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node). You must then move towards the next-level neighbour nodes.**\r\n\r\n43. **What is a merge sort?**\r\n\r\n**Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It is based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. Merge sort continuously cuts down a list into multiple sublists until each has only one item, then merges those sublists into a sorted list.**\r\n\r\n44. **what is the working of selection sort ?**\r\n\r\n**Selection sort works by taking the smallest element in an unsorted array and bringing it to the front. You'll go through each item (from left to right) until you find the smallest one. The first item in the array is now sorted, while the rest of the array is unsorted.**\r\n\r\n45. **What is the working principle of quick sort?**\r\n\r\n**Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot'element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort.**\r\n\r\n46. **how does bubble sort work ?**\r\n\r\n**Bubble sort is a basic algorithm for arranging a string of numbers or other elements in the correct order. The method works by examining each set of adjacent elements in**\r\n\r\n**the string, from left to right, switching their positions if they are out of order.**\r\n\r\n47. **Which is the best sorting algorithm?**\r\n\r\n**If you've observed, the time complexity of Quicksort is O(n logn) in the best and average case scenarios and O(n^2) in the worst case. But since it has the upper hand in the average cases for most inputs, Quicksort is generally considered the “fastest” sorting algorithm.**\r\n\r\n48. **What is the radix sort?**\r\n\r\n**Radix sort is an integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys by individual digits that share the same significant position and value (place value).**\r\n\r\n49. **Disadvantages of Radix Sort Algorithm**\r\n\r\n**-The Radix Sort algorithm is less flexible than other sorts because it is based on digits or letters. As a result, for each different type of data, it must be rewritten.**\r\n\r\n**-Radix sort has a higher constant than other sorting algorithms.**\r\n\r\n**-It takes up more space than Quicksort, which is used for in-place sorting.**\r\n\r\n**-Radix sort may be slower than other sorting algorithms such as merge sort and Quicksort if the operations are inefficient. These operations include sub-inset lists and delete functions, as well as the process of isolating the desired digits.**\r\n\r\n**-Because it is based on digits or letters, the radix sort is less flexible than other sorts. If the data type must be rewritten, so must the Radix sort.**\r\n\r\n50. **what do you understand by shell sort ?**\r\n\r\n**Shell sort is a sorting algorithm that is highly efficient and is based on the insertion sort algorithm. This algorithm avoids large shifts, as in insertion sort, where the smaller value is on the far right and must be moved to the far left.**\r\n\r\n51. **what is the meaning of stack in data structure ?**\r\n\r\n**A Stack is a linear data structure that holds a linear, ordered sequence of elements. It is an abstract data type. A Stack works on the LIFO process (Last In First Out), i.e., the element that was inserted last will be removed first.**\r\n\r\n52. **Why do we use heap over stack?**\r\n\r\n**Stack accesses local variables only while Heap allows you to access variables globally. Stack variables can't be resized whereas Heap variables can be resized. Stack memory is allocated in a contiguous block whereas Heap memory is allocated in any random order.**\r\n\r\n53. **What are the applications of stack?**\r\n\r\n**A Stack can be used for evaluating expressions consisting of operands and operators. Stacks can be used for Backtracking, i.e., to check parenthesis matching in an expression. It can also be used to convert one form of expression to another form. It can be used for systematic Memory Management.**\r\n\r\n54. **Operations Performed on Stacks :-**\r\n\r\n**push :Adds an element to the top of the stack. pop :Removes the topmost element from the stack. isEmpty :Checks whether the stack is empty. isFull :Checks whether the stack is full.**\r\n\r\n**top :Displays the topmost element of the stack.**\r\n\r\n55. **which data structure is used to perform recursion ?**\r\n\r\n**Stack**\r\n\r\n**Stack(LIFO) data structure is one of the famous data structures used for implementing recursion.**\r\n\r\n56. **What is overflow and underflow in stack?**\r\n\r\n**Stack Underflow —An error called when an item is called from a stack, but the stack is empty. Stack Overflow —An error called when an item is pushed onto a stack, but the stack is full. (Also a website you can visit to obtain answers to any programming related questions).**\r\n\r\n57. **in how many ways we can implement stack ?**\r\n\r\n**A stack can be implemented by means of Array, Structure, Pointer, and Linked List.**\r\n\r\n58. **What is a queue in data structure?**\r\n\r\n**A queue is linear data structure that consists of a collection is of items that follow a first-in-first-out sequence. This implies that the first item to be inserted will be the** **first to be removed. You can also say that items are removed in the order they were inserted.**\r\n\r\n59. **What is the priority queue?**\r\n\r\n**Priority queue in a data structure is an extension of a linear queue that possesses the following properties:Every element has a certain priority assigned to it. Every element of this queue must be comparable. It will delete the element with higher priority before the element with lower priority.**\r\n\r\n60. **what is the meaning of deque ?**\r\n\r\n**Deque is a data structure that inherits the properties of both queues and stacks. Additionally, the implementation of this data structure requires constant time, i.e., time complexity = O(1). This means you can use deque to your advantage to implement both the queue and stack.**\r\n\r\n61. **what are the disadvantages of implementing queue using array ?**\r\n\r\n**Implementing a queue using a simple array has a few disadvantages:Fixed size:A simple array has a fixed size, which means that once it is full, it cannot accommodate any more elements. This can lead to overflow or underflow errors if the queue is not properly managed.**\r\n\r\n62. **how can elements be inserted in the circular queue ?**\r\n\r\n**enQueue(value) This function is used to insert an element into the circular queue. In a circular queue, the new element is always inserted at the rear position. Check whether the queue is full – [i.e., the rear end is in just before the front end in a circular manner]. If it is full then display Queue is full.**\r\n\r\n63. **Basic operation perform on queue :-**\r\n\r\n**The basic operations performed on a queue are: Enqueue:Adds an element to the rear of the queue. Dequeue:Removes an element from the front of the queue.**\r\n\r\n**IsEmpty:Checks if the queue is empty. Front:**\r\n\r\n**Rear:**\r\n\r\n64. **What are the applications of queue?**\r\n\r\n**Queues are used to manage data flow and handle tasks in various applications, such as operating systems, network protocols, and data processing systems. They are also**\r\n\r\n**used to implement algorithms like breadth-first search, which involves exploring**\r\n\r\n**nodes in a graph level-by-level.**\r\n\r\n65. **What is the condition for circular queue to be full?**\r\n\r\n**A circular queue will be full when Front = -1and Rear = max – 1. Now, let us consider an empty circular queue C which has front and rear pointers F and R, pointing to the first and last element of the queue. Since the queue is empty, the pointers won't be pointing to any node, hence, they will be pointing to NULL.**\r\n\r\n66. **explain the concept of priority queue :-**\r\n\r\n**Priority queue in a data structure is an extension of a linear queue that possesses the following properties:Every element has a certain priority assigned to it. Every element of this queue must be comparable. It will delete the element with higher priority before the element with lower priority.**\r\n\r\n67. **Which data structure is used in graph?**\r\n\r\n**A graph can be represented using 3 data structures- adjacency matrix, adjacency list and adjacency set. An adjacency matrix can be thought of as a table with rows and columns.**\r\n\r\n68. **What is a graph in data structure?**\r\n\r\n**A graph is a non-linear kind of data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges. The edges connect any two nodes in the graph, and the nodes are also known as** **vertices. This graph has a set of vertices V= { 1,2,3,4,5} and a set of edges E= { (1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,5),(4,50 }.**\r\n\r\n69. **What is the difference between directed graph and undirected graph?**\r\n\r\n**A directed graph, where edges have direction (meaning that edges with arrows connect one vertex to another). An undirected graph, where edges have no direction (meaning arrowless connections). It's basically the same as a directed graph but has bi-directional connections between nodes.**\r\n\r\n70. **differentiate among cycle, path and circuit :-**\r\n\r\n**A path that does not repeat vertices is called a simple path.**\r\n\r\n**A circuit is path that begins and ends at the same vertex.**\r\n\r\n**A circuit that doesn't repeat vertices is called a cycle.**\r\n\r\n**A graph is said to be connected if any two of its vertices are joined by a path.**\r\n\r\n71. **explain dynamic programming :-**\r\n\r\n**Dynamic programming is a process to solve optimization problems. In software development projects, dynamic programming uses an algorithm that breaks down complex coding problems into subproblems.**\r\n\r\n72. **what are some examples of dynamic programming algorithms ? -fibonacci number series**\r\n\r\n    **-knapsack problem**\r\n\r\n    **-tower of hanoi**\r\n\r\n    **-all pair shortest path by floyd-warshall**\r\n\r\n    **-shortest path by dijkstra**\r\n\r\n    **-project scheduling**\r\n\r\n73. **What do you mean by binary tree?**\r\n\r\n**A “binary tree”is a tree data structure where every node has two child nodes (at the most) that form the tree branches. These child nodes are called left and right child** **nodes. This tutorial will help you understand the fundamental technicalities of binary trees with all the necessary details and practical examples.**\r\n\r\n74. **what is a binary search tree ?**\r\n\r\n**A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure that helps maintain a sorted list of numbers. It's called a binary tree because each node can have a maximum of two children. It's called a search tree because it can be used to search for a number in O(log(n)) time.**\r\n\r\n75. **what is the meaning of an AVL tree ?**\r\n\r\n**an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.**\r\n\r\n76. **where are the tree data structured used ?**\r\n\r\n**Trees are commonly used to represent or manipulate hierarchical data in applications such as:File systems for:Directory structure used to organize subdirectories and files (symbolic links create non-tree graphs, as do multiple hard links to the same file or directory).**\r\n\r\n77. **what is the method used for inorder traversal in trees ?**\r\n\r\n**Inorder traversal is defined as a type of tree traversal technique which follows the Left-Root-Right pattern, such that:The left subtree is traversed first. Then the root node for that subtree is traversed. Finally, the right subtree is traversed.**\r\n\r\n78. **How does Postorder traversal work?**\r\n\r\n**The post order traversal technique follows the Left Right Root policy. Here, Left Right Root means the left subtree of the root node is traversed first, then the right subtree, and finally, the root node is traversed. Here, the Postorder name itself suggests that the tree's root node would be traversed at last.**\r\n\r\n79. **what is a tree data structure ?**\r\n\r\n**A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure that stores data in a hierarchical fashion. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by links and represent a hierarchy. The topmost node is called the root node.**\r\n\r\n80. **define the basic terminology in tree data structure ?**\r\n\r\n**A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes. Nodes represent value and nodes are connected by edges. A tree has the following properties:The tree has one node called root. The tree originates from this, and hence it does not have any parent.**\r\n\r\n81. **What are the three types of tree traversals?**\r\n\r\n**There are three commonly used patterns to visit all the nodes in a tree. The difference between these patterns is the order in which each node is visited. We call this visitation of the nodes a “traversal.”The three traversals we will look at are called preorder, inorder, and postorder.**\r\n\r\n**BFS:**\r\n\r\n**DFS:**\r\n\r\n82. **what is full binary tree and complete binary tree ?**\r\n\r\n**In a full binary tree every node has either 0 or 2 child nodes. In a complete binary tree, all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level. There is no particular sequence for filling in nodes. All nodes should be on the left. This means that there is no node that has a right child but not a left child.**\r\n\r\n83. **What do you mean by B-tree?**\r\n\r\n**B Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure. It stores and maintains data in a sorted form where the left children of the root are smaller than the root and the right children are larger than the root in value. It makes searching efficient and allows all operations in logarithmic time.**\r\n\r\n84. **What are different types of binary tree?**\r\n\r\n**5 Types of Binary Tree :**\r\n\r\n**-Full Binary Tree. It is a special kind of a binary tree that has either zero children or two children. ...**\r\n\r\n**-Complete Binary Tree. ...**\r\n\r\n**-Perfect Binary Tree. ...**\r\n\r\n**-Balanced Binary Tree. ...**\r\n\r\n**-Degenerate Binary Tree.**\r\n\r\n85. **what are the difference between b tree and b+ tree ?**\r\n\r\n**B tree is a self-balancing tree that helps in maintaining and sorting data, and also grants searches, insertions, deletions, and sequential access. Whereas, B+ tree is an extension of the B tree that helps in reducing the drawback linked with the B tree. Let’s find out some major differences between the B tree and the B+ tree.**\r\n\r\n86. **What are the various operations of AVL tree?**\r\n\r\n**The AVL tree structuring is implemented with the three basic data structure operations, namely search, insert and delete.**\r\n\r\n87. **What is degree of node in tree?**\r\n\r\n**In the tree data structure, the total number of children of a node is called the degree of the node. The highest degree of the node among all the nodes in a tree is called the Degree of Tree.**\r\n\r\n88. **what is the degree of a tree ?**\r\n\r\n**Degree. In the tree data structure, the total number of children of a node is called the degree of the node. The highest degree of the node among all the nodes in a tree is called the Degree of Tree.**\r\n\r\n89. **explain spanning tree :-**\r\n\r\n**A spanning tree is defined as a subset of a connected undirected graph that has all the vertices covered with the minimum number of edges possible. A graph is a set of vertices and edges that are connected with each other, there are mainly three types of graphs, which are directed, undirected, and connected.**\r\n\r\n90. **What do you mean by minimum spanning tree?**\r\n\r\n**A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted graph that connects all the vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. It is a way of finding the most economical way to connect a set of vertices.**\r\n\r\n91. **explain the max heap data structure :-**\r\n\r\n**A max heap is a complete binary tree in which the value of a node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. Max Heap data structure is useful for sorting data using heap sort. In this tutorial, we will cover everything you need to know to implement max heaps in java from scratch.**\r\n\r\n92. **explain the jagged array :-**\r\n\r\n**In computer science, a jagged array, also known as a ragged array or irregular array is an array of arrays of which the member arrays can be of different lengths, producing rows of jagged edges when visualized as output.**\r\n\r\n93. **how do you find the height of a node in a tree ?**\r\n\r\n**The depth of a node is the number of edges present in path from the root node of a tree to that node. The height of a node is the number of edges present in the longest path connecting that node to a leaf node.**\r\n\r\n94. **explain a spanning tree . what is the maximum number of spanning trees ? Spanning tree has n-1edges, where n is the number of nodes (vertices). From a complete graph, by removing maximum e - n + 1edges, we can construct a spanning tree. A complete graph can have maximum nn-2 number of spanning trees.**\r\n95. **How does Huffman Coding work?**\r\n\r\n**The algorithm works by building a tree T in a bottoms-up manner using a priority queue Q that selects the two least frequent objects and merges them together, in turn creating a new object whose frequency is the sum of the frequencies of the two merged objects.**\r\n\r\n96. **What Is a Recursive Algorithm?**\r\n\r\n**A recursive algorithm calls itself with smaller input values and returns the result for the current input by carrying out basic operations on the returned value for the smaller input.**\r\n\r\n97. **What is Dijkstra's algorithm in detail?**\r\n\r\n**Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between the two mentioned vertices of a graph by applying the Greedy Algorithm as the basis of principle. For Example:Used to find the shortest between the destination to visit from your current location on a Google map.**\r\n\r\n98. **what are the different approaches to design an algorithm ?**\r\n\r\n**Dynamic programming:**\r\n\r\n**This technique involves solving a problem by combining stored solutions to smaller subproblems.**\r\n\r\n**Greedy algorithms:**\r\n\r\n**These algorithms make the best choice at each step to find the best way to solve the entire problem.**\r\n\r\n**Backtracking:**\r\n\r\n**This technique involves trying one way, and if it's not efficient, going back to the previous state and trying another path.**\r\n\r\n**Randomized algorithms:**\r\n\r\n**These algorithms use random input to achieve good performance in the average case.

You probably don't know it well enough!","image":"java.png","isFeatured":false,"date":"2024-08-21","content":"\r\n**1.what is java ?**\r\n\r\n**Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence, as code written in Java can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's designed to be portable, secure, and robust, making it widely used in various domains, including software development, web applications, mobile apps, and more.**\r\n\r\n**2.why java is not 100% object oriented ?**\r\n\r\n**Java is considered mostly object-oriented, but it's not entirely 100% object-oriented due to the following reasons:**\r\n\r\n**Primitive Data Types: Java includes primitive data types (int, double, boolean, etc.) that are not objects. These types do not inherit from a common class and don't have behavior or methods associated with them.**\r\n\r\n**Static Members: Java supports static methods and variables that belong to a class rather than to instances of the class. Static members are not associated with objects and can be accessed without object instantiation, deviating from pure object-oriented principles.**\r\n\r\n**These aspects introduce a level of deviation from complete object-oriented purity in Java. However, the language primarily follows object-oriented paradigms by emphasizing object creation, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.**\r\n\r\n**3.Why pointer are not used in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Pointers are not used in Java mainly for two reasons:**\r\n\r\n**Safety and Security: Pointers in languages like C and C++ allow direct memory manipulation, which can lead to issues like memory leaks, dangling pointers, and unauthorized access to memory locations. Java was designed to prioritize safety and security by implementing automatic memory management through the use of a garbage collector. Java's memory model abstracts pointers to prevent developers from directly accessing memory locations, reducing the likelihood of such errors.**\r\n\r\n**Platform Independence: Java aimed to be platform-independent by introducing the concept of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Using pointers could complicate the portability of Java programs across di\u0000erent platforms because pointers are highly dependent on the underlying hardware architecture. By abstracting pointers and memory management, Java ensures that programs can run consistently on any platform with a JVM without concerns about memory addresses or pointer sizes.**\r\n\r\n**4.what is JIT compiler in java ?**\r\n\r\n**A just-in-time (JIT) compiler is a program that turns bytecode into instructions that can be sent directly to a computer's processor (CPU). Typically, compilers are key in deciding the speed of an application for developers and end users.**\r\n\r\n**5.Why strings are immutable in Java?**\r\n\r\n**The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to** **not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.**\r\n\r\n**6.what is a market interface in java ?**\r\n\r\n**A marker interface is an interface that doesn't have any methods or constants inside it. It provides run-time type information about objects, so the compiler and JVM have additional information about the object. A marker interface is also called a tagging interface.**\r\n\r\n**7.can you override a private or static method in java ?**\r\n\r\n**You cannot override a private or static method in Java. If you create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the super class method; this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in sub class because it's not accessible there.**\r\n\r\n**No, we cannot override static methods because method overriding is based on dynamic binding at runtime and the static methods are bonded using static binding at compile time.**\r\n\r\n**8.does finally always excute in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Yes, the finally block in Java always executes, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. It is used to clean up resources, such as closing files or database connections.**\r\n\r\n**9.what method does the object class have in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The Object class in Java is the root of the class hierarchy. All other classes in Java inherit directly or indirectly from the Object class. The Object class has several methods that are inherited by all other classes, including:**\r\n\r\n**toString() Method.**\r\n\r\n**hashCode() Method.**\r\n\r\n**equals(Object obj) Method. getClass() method.**\r\n\r\n**finalize() method.**\r\n\r\n**clone() method.**\r\n\r\n**wait(), notify() notifyAll() Methods.**\r\n\r\n**10.how can you make a class immutable in java ?**\r\n\r\n**To make a class immutable in Java, you need to follow these general principles:**\r\n\r\n**-Declare the class as final: so it can't be extended.**\r\n\r\n**-Make all of the fields private: so that direct access is not allowed. -Don't provide setter methods: for variables.**\r\n\r\n**-Make all mutable fields final: so that a field's value can be assigned only once.**\r\n\r\n**-Initialize all fields using a constructor method: performing deep copy.**\r\n\r\n**-Perform cloning of objects: in the getter methods to return a copy rather than returning the actual object reference.**\r\n\r\n**public final class ImmutableClass {**\r\n\r\n**private final int value;**\r\n\r\n**public ImmutableClass(int value) {**\r\n\r\n**this.value = value;**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**public int getValue() {**\r\n\r\n**return value;**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**11.what is singleton class in java and how can we make a class singleton ?**\r\n\r\n**A singleton class is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The singleton pattern is often used for resources such as database connections or configuration settings.**\r\n\r\n**There are many ways to implement a singleton class in Java. One common way is to use a private constructor and a static method to get the instance of the class.**\r\n\r\n**For example:**\r\n\r\n**public class Singleton {**\r\n\r\n**private static Singleton instance;**\r\n\r\n**private Singleton() {}**\r\n\r\n**public static Singleton getInstance() {**\r\n\r\n**if (instance == null) {**\r\n\r\n**instance = new Singleton();**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**return instance;**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n12. **What is a ClassLoader?**\r\n\r\n**A classloader in Java is a subsystem of Java Virtual Machine, dedicated to loading class files when a program is executed; ClassLoader is the first to load the executable file. Java has Bootstrap, Extension, and Application classloaders.**\r\n\r\n13. **what are the memory allocations available in java ?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, memory allocation refers to the process of setting aside virtual memory sections in a program to store variables and instances of classes and structures. The memory isn't allocated to an object at declaration time, but only a reference is created. The new() method is used to allocate memory to the object, so the object is always allocated memory on the heap.**\r\n\r\n**The Memory allocation in java is divided into parts, namely- Heap, Stack, Code, and Static.**\r\n\r\n14. **WILL THE PROGRAM RUN IF I WRITE STATIC PUBLIC VOID MAIN in java ?**\r\n\r\n    **If you write static public void instead of public static void then it**\r\n\r\n    **is perfectly OK. Your Java program will compile and run successfully. It doesn't really make any di\u0000erence as long as method name comes last and return type of method comes second last.**\r\n\r\n15. **what is default value stored in local variable in java ?**\r\n\r\n**There is no default value for local variables, so local variables should be declared and an initial value should be assigned before the first use.**\r\n\r\n16. **What is the Association?**\r\n\r\n**Association in Java is a connection or relation between two separate classes that are set up through their objects. Association relationship indicates how objects know each other and how they are using each other's functionality. It can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many.**\r\n\r\n17. **define copy constructor in java ?**\r\n\r\n**A copy constructor is a special type of constructor that allows you to create a new object that is an exact copy of an existing object. It is a very useful feature when you want to create a new object without having to manually copy all of the properties of the existing object.**\r\n\r\n**To define a copy constructor in Java, you simply need to create a constructor that takes the existing object as a parameter and then copies all of its properties to the new object.**\r\n\r\n**The following code shows an example of a copy constructor in Java:**\r\n\r\n**public class MyClass {**\r\n\r\n**private int x;**\r\n\r\n**private int y;**\r\n\r\n**public MyClass(int x, int y) {**\r\n\r\n**this.x = x;**\r\n\r\n**this.y = y;**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**// Copy constructor**\r\n\r\n**public MyClass(MyClass other) {**\r\n\r\n**this.x = other.x;**\r\n\r\n**this.y = other.y;**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n18. **what is a marker interface in java ?**\r\n\r\n**A marker interface is an interface that doesn't have any methods or constants inside it. It provides run-time type information about objects, so the compiler and JVM have additional information** **about the object. A marker interface is also called a tagging interface.**\r\n\r\n19. **what is object cloning in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Object cloning in Java is the process of creating an exact copy of an object. It is a way to create a duplicate of an object without a\u0000ecting the original object.**\r\n\r\n**To clone an object, you can use the clone() method. The clone() method is a protected method in the Object class. To use it, you must first declare the class as implementing the Cloneable interface.**\r\n\r\n**The following code shows how to clone an object: public class MyClass implements Cloneable {**\r\n\r\n**private int x; private String y;**\r\n\r\n**public MyClass(int x, String y) {**\r\n\r\n**this.x = x;**\r\n\r\n**this.y = y;**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**@Override**\r\n\r\n**public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {**\r\n\r\n**return super.clone();**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**}**\r\n\r\n**20.What is meant by wrapper class in Java?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, a wrapper class is a class that wraps one or more primitive data types. Wrapper classes are very common in java.** **For example, String, Integer and Boolean are wrapper classes. Wrapper classes are used to treat primitive data types as objects.**\r\n\r\n21. **What is a package in Java?**\r\n\r\n**A Java package is a set of classes, interfaces, and sub-packages that are similar. In Java, it divides packages into two types: built-in packages and user-defined packages. Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API) and User-defined Packages are the two types of packages (create your own packages).**\r\n\r\n22. **What is the di\u0000erence between instance variables and local variables in Java?**\r\n\r\n    **An instance variable is a variable that is declared in a class but outside a method while the local variable is a variable declared within a method or a constructor. Thus, this is the main di\u0000erence between instance variable and local variable.**\r\n\r\n23. **explain java string pool ?**\r\n\r\n**String pool is a storage space in the Java heap memory where string literals are stored. It is also known as String Constant Pool or String Intern Pool. It is privately maintained by the Java String class. By default, the String pool is empty.**\r\n\r\n24. **what is an exception in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Definition: An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it o\u0000 to the runtime system.**\r\n\r\n25. **What is the final keyword in java?**\r\n\r\n**The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable** **(impossible to inherit or override). The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...). The final keyword is called a \"modifier\".**\r\n\r\n26. **what happens when main isn't declared as static in java ?**\r\n\r\n**If the main method is not declared static, the JVM has to create an instance of the main Class, and because the constructor might be overloaded and include arguments, there will be no reliable and consistent way for the JVM to find the main method in Java.**\r\n\r\n27. **what is jdk? mention the variants of jdk in java .**\r\n\r\n**The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment that includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java compiler, and other development tools. It is used to develop Java applications and applets.**\r\n\r\n**The JDK is a collection of tools and libraries needed to develop Java applications. It includes the Java compiler, debugger, and other tools.**\r\n\r\n**Here are some of the most popular variants of the JDK:**\r\n\r\n**Oracle JDK**\r\n\r\n**OpenJDK**\r\n\r\n**IBM JDK**\r\n\r\n**Amazon Corretto**\r\n\r\n**Azul Platform Core (Zulu)**\r\n\r\n**Microsoft Build of OpenJDK**\r\n\r\n**SAPMachine**\r\n\r\n**Azul Platform Prime (Zing)**\r\n\r\n28. **brief access specifiers and its types in java :-**\r\n\r\n**Here are the access specifiers and their types in Java: Public:**\r\n\r\n**Public access specifiers are the most accessible type of access specifier. They can be accessed from anywhere in the program. Protected:**\r\n\r\n**Protected access specifiers are accessible within the same package and to subclasses in other packages.**\r\n\r\n**Private:**\r\n\r\n**Private access specifiers are the least accessible type of access specifier. They can only be accessed within the class in which they are declared.**\r\n\r\n**Default (Package-private):**\r\n\r\n**Default access specifiers are accessible within the same package. They cannot be accessed from outside the package.**\r\n\r\n29. **can a constructor return a value in java ?**\r\n\r\n**No, constructor does not return any value. While declaring a constructor you will not have anything like return type. In general, Constructor is implicitly called at the time of instantiation. And it is not a method, its sole purpose is to initialize the instance variables.**\r\n\r\n30. **What is this keyword in Java?**\r\n\r\n**The keyword 'this' in Java serves a fundamental purpose: it refers to the current object. In other words, 'this' represents the instance of the class where it's used. It's commonly used to access or modify the fields of the current object, especially when field names are the same as local variable names.**\r\n\r\n31. **What is method overloading and method overriding in Java? Definition: Method overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but di\u0000erent parameters within the same class, while method overriding involves creating a method** **in the child class that has the same name, parameters, and return type as a method in the parent class.**\r\n32. **Can We Overload Static Methods In Java?**\r\n\r\n**Yes, we can overload static methods in Java. Method overloading in Java allows us to have multiple methods with the same name in a class, but they must have di\u0000erent parameter lists.**\r\n\r\n33. **Late binding: -**\r\n\r\n**In the late binding or dynamic binding, the compiler doesn't decide the method to be called. Overriding is a perfect example of dynamic binding. In overriding both parent and child classes have the same method.**\r\n\r\n34. **What is a dynamic method dispatch in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Dynamic Method Dispatch in Java is the process by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime (during the code execution). The concept of method overriding is the way to attain runtime polymorphism in Java. During the code execution, JVM decides which implementation of the same method should be called.**\r\n\r\n35. **Why is the delete function faster in the linked list than an array?**\r\n\r\n    **The delete function is generally faster in a linked list than in an array due to the di\u0000erence in data structure. In a linked list, deleting an element involves simply changing the references of the adjacent nodes to bypass the node being deleted.**\r\n\r\n    **The insertion, addition, and removal operations are faster in a LinkedList because there is no resizing of an array done in the background. When a new item is added somewhere in the middle** **of the list, only references in surrounding elements need to change.**\r\n\r\n36. **The life cycle of a thread in Java consists of the following stages:**\r\n\r\n    **-New: A thread is created but not yet started.**\r\n\r\n    **-Runnable: A thread is ready to run, but the scheduler has not selected it to be the running thread.**\r\n\r\n    **-Running: When the thread is executing its task.**\r\n\r\n    **-Blocked: When the thread is waiting for some resource or lock. -Waiting: When the thread is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action without any time limit.**\r\n\r\n    **-Timed Waiting: When the thread is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action for a specified interval of time. -Terminated: When the thread has completed its task or otherwise terminates.**\r\n\r\n37. **brief the life cycle of an applet in java : -**\r\n\r\n**The Applet Life Cycle in Java can be defined as the process of how an applet object is created, started, stopped, and destroyed during the entire execution of the applet. There are mainly five core methods used in the Applet Life Cycle in Java namely, init() start()**\r\n\r\n38. **Why are generics used in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Generics in Java are used to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with di\u0000erent types of data. This can help to improve code reusability and reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.**\r\n\r\n39. **Interface Externalizable: -**\r\n\r\n**The writeExternal and readExternal methods of the Externalizable interface are implemented by a class to give the class complete control over the format and contents of the stream for an object and its supertypes. These methods must explicitly coordinate with the supertype to save its state.**\r\n\r\n40. **What is Daemon Thread in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Daemon thread in Java is a low-priority thread that performs background operations such as garbage collection, finalizer, Action Listeners, Signal dispatches, etc. Daemon thread in Java is also a service provider thread that helps the user thread.**\r\n\r\n41. **enumeration in java : -**\r\n\r\n**Enum, introduced in Java 5, is a special data type that consists of a set of pre-defined named values separated by commas. These named values are also known as elements or enumerators or enum instances. Since the values in the enum type are constant, you should always represent them in UPPERCASE letters.**\r\n\r\n42. **why is java is dynamic in nature ?**\r\n\r\n**Java is considered a dynamic language because of its ability to adapt to changing environments and handle unexpected events at runtime. Some of the key features that contribute to Java's dynamic nature include:**\r\n\r\n43. **can you run a code before executing the main method ?**\r\n\r\n**No, main method is the entry point of a Java application. So basically, anything before main() execution is done internally by Java itself, so we explicitely can't hinder those processes. In Java code we use the main () method to start our code so that JVM will search for main () method and starts execution.**\r\n\r\n44. **how many times the finalize method called in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The finalize() method in Java is a method that is called by the garbage collector just before an object is garbage collected. It is a public method that is defined in the Object class. It is not guaranteed that the finalize() method will be called, and it is not recommended to rely on it for critical cleanup operations.**\r\n\r\n45. **can we use this and super together in java ?**\r\n\r\n**No, we cannot use the this() and super() in the same constructor. If we want to use this() or super() inside a constructor, they must be written (executed) at first. Both this() and super() cannot be executed simultaneously, hence “this()” and “super()” in Java cannot be used in the same constructor.**\r\n\r\n46. **What is JSP in Java with example?**\r\n\r\n**JavaServer Page (JSP) is Java's answer to the popular Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP). JSP, like ASP, provides a simplified and fast mean to generate dynamic web contents. It allows you to mix static HTML with dynamically generated HTML - in the way that the business logic and the presentation are well separated.**\r\n\r\n47. **JDBC : -**\r\n\r\n**JDBC is a Java database API that was created as an industry standard for making connections between Java applications and other databases. The Java JDBC connection in Java API defines all classes that handle various aspects of the database, such as connection details, result sets, and database metadata.**\r\n\r\n48. **What are the various directives in JSP?**\r\n\r\n**They provide commands or directions to the container on how to deal with and manage certain JSP processing portions. Directives can contain several attributes that are separated by a comma** **and act as key-value pairs. In JSP, directives are described with a pair of \u003c%@ .... %\u003e tags.**\r\n\r\n49. **What is observable and Observer in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Observer : Any object that wishes to be notified when the state of another object changes. Observable : Any object whose state may be of interest, and in whom another object may register an interest.**\r\n\r\n50. **what is session management in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Servlet Session Management is a mechanism in Java used by Web container to store session information. Session tracking is a way to manage the data of a user, this is known as session management in servlet. Session in Java are managed through di\u0000erent ways, such as, HTTP Session API, Cookies, URL rewriting, etc.**\r\n\r\n51. **brief about spring framework in java : -**\r\n\r\n**The Spring Framework is an open-source framework for building enterprise Java applications. Spring aims to simplify the complex and cumbersome enterprise Java application development process by o\u0000ering a framework that includes technologies such as: Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) Dependency injection (DI).**\r\n\r\n52. **What is the JCA program in Java?**\r\n\r\n**The Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) is a robust set of APIs that provide essential cryptographic functionality for the Java programming language. It is used in various applications, including secure communications, digital signatures, key management, and password authentication.**\r\n\r\n53. **What is meant by JPA in Java?**\r\n\r\n**JPA stands for Java Persistence API. It is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that allows us to map Java objects to tables in a relational database.**\r\n\r\n54. **explain the di\u0000erent authentication in java servlets : -**\r\n\r\n**There are four types of authentication available in Servlets:**\r\n\r\n1. **HTTP Basic Authentication:**\r\n\r\n**This is the least secure type of authentication. In this, the server uses the username and password provided by the client and these credentials are transmitted using simple base64 encoding.**\r\n\r\n2. **HTTP Digest Authentication:**\r\n\r\n**This is similar to Basic Authentication, but with an additional precaution to prevent a third party from doing eavesdrop on the http packets and easily read the username and password.**\r\n\r\n3. **HTTPS Client Authentication:**\r\n\r\n**This is a more secure method of authentication than either basic or form-based authentication. It uses HTTP over SSL, in which the server and, optionally, the client authenticate one another using public key certificates.**\r\n\r\n4. **Form-based Authentication:**\r\n\r\n**This is the most secure type of authentication. In this, the user is presented with a login form where they enter their username and password. These credentials are then sent to the server for authentication.**\r\n\r\n55. **how is a java program executed ?**\r\n\r\n**The Java compiler takes the source code and produces bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The bytecode is loaded into the JVM, and the JVM interprets the bytecode and executes the program. The code cannot be compiled** **because of compilation errors. Debugging is mainly done in run-time.**\r\n\r\n56. **How is java platform independent ?**\r\n\r\n**Java is platform-independent because it is compiled to a bytecode that can be run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that you can write a Java program on one platform (such as Windows) and then run it on a di\u0000erent platform (such as macOS or Linux) without making any changes to the code.**\r\n\r\n57. **What are Methods in Java?**\r\n\r\n**A method in Java is a block of code that, when called, performs specific actions mentioned in it. For instance, if you have written instructions to draw a circle in the method, it will do that task. You can insert values or parameters into methods, and they will only be executed when called.**\r\n\r\n58. **what is java main method ?**\r\n\r\n**The Java main method is usually the first method you learn about when you start programming in Java because its the entry point for executing a Java program. The main method can contain code to execute or call other methods, and it can be placed in any class that's part of a program.**\r\n\r\n59. **what is (string args) that always appeared on the java main method ?**\r\n\r\n    **String[]args in Java, i.e., a command line argument array, is used in Java to retrieve input from the console. It is worth noting that, You can access the String args in Java only in static blocks, such as Main. The rest of your system, including any non-static objects, cannot access it.**\r\n\r\n60. **what is a static method ?**\r\n\r\n**A static method (or static function) is a method defined as a member of an object but is accessible directly from an API object's constructor, rather than from an object instance created via the constructor.**\r\n\r\n61. **can we overload the main method in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Yes, we can overload the main() method in Java. A Java class can have any number of overloaded main() methods. But the very first thing JVM (Java Virtual Machine) seeks is the original main() method, i.e., public static void main(String[] args) to execute.**\r\n\r\n62. **what is constructor in java ?**\r\n\r\n**A constructor in Java Programming is a block of code that initializes (constructs) the state and value during object creation. It is called every time an object with the help of a new () keyword is created. Even if you haven't specified any constructor in the code, the Java compiler calls a default constructor.**\r\n\r\n63. **Types of Constructor in Java Default Constructor.**\r\n\r\n    **No-Args constructor. Parameterized constructor.**\r\n\r\n64. **What is the main di\u0000erence between a Constructor and a Method?**\r\n\r\n    **A constructor helps in initializing an object, has no return type and cannot be inherited by subclasses. On the other hand, a method executes operations, returns a value, and can be inherited by subclasses.**\r\n\r\n65. **what is inheritance in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system). The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.**\r\n\r\n**In Java, inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword.**\r\n\r\n66. **What is superclass and subclass in Java with example? Subclasses, Superclasses, and Inheritance**\r\n\r\n    **In Java, as in other object-oriented programming languages, classes can be derived from other classes. The derived class (the class that is derived from another class) is called a subclass. The class from which its derived is called the superclass. In fact, in Java, all classes must be derived from some class.**\r\n\r\n67. **what is final variable in java ?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, the final keyword is used to denote constants. It can be used with variables, methods, and classes. Once any entity (variable, method or class) is declared final , it can be assigned only once. That is, the final variable cannot be reinitialized with another value.**\r\n\r\n68. **what are abstract classes in java ?**\r\n\r\n**An abstract class**\r\n\r\n**is a class that cannot be instantiated. It can only be subclassed. Abstract**\r\n\r\n**classes are used to provide a common set of methods and variables for subclasses.**\r\n\r\n**To create an abstract class, you use the abstract keyword.**\r\n\r\n69. **what is the di\u0000erence between jdk,jre and jvm ?**\r\n\r\n**Here are some di\u0000erences between JDK, JRE, and JVM:**\r\n\r\n**JDK:**\r\n\r\n**A software development kit that contains tools for developing, monitoring, and debugging Java code. JDK is primarily used for code execution and development.**\r\n\r\n**JRE:**\r\n\r\n**A software bundle that allows Java programs to run. JRE is a set of software tools designed for running other software. JRE contains class libraries and other supporting files required by JVM for executing Java programs.**\r\n\r\n**JVM:**\r\n\r\n**An environment for executing bytecode.**\r\n\r\n70. **how many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM ?**\r\n\r\n**The Java virtual machine memory area is a runtime area that is used for the execution of various programs involved during runtime of a java application, the memory area of JVM is broadly divided into five di\u0000erent parts which are method area, heap area, Stack, Program counter (PC) registers area and Native method area ..**\r\n\r\n71. **why is main method static in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The main() method is declared static so that JVM can call it without creating an instance of the class containing the main() method. We must declare the main() function static as no class object is present when the java runtime starts. JVM can then load the class into the main memory and invoke the main() method.**\r\n\r\n72. **how is exception handling implemented in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The try-catch is the simplest method of handling exceptions. Put the code you want to run in the try block, and any Java** **exceptions that the code throws are caught by one or more catch blocks. This method will catch any type of Java exceptions that get thrown. This is the simplest mechanism for handling exceptions.**\r\n\r\n73. **can you catch multiple exception in a single catch block in java ?**\r\n\r\n    **Yes, you can catch multiple exceptions in a single catch block in Java. This feature was introduced in Java 7. To do this, you can use the pipe (|) symbol to separate the exception types that you want to catch in the catch block.**\r\n\r\n74. **what are the principles of object oriented programming in java ?**\r\n\r\n    **The main ideas behind Java's Object-Oriented Programming, OOP concepts include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Basically, Java OOP concepts let us create working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of them without compromising security.**\r\n\r\n75. **what are di\u0000erence between abstract class and interface in java ?**\r\n\r\n    **An abstract class comes with non-final variables. A Java interface comes with variables declared final by default. An abstract class in Java includes final, non-final, static, and non-static variables. An interface in Java comes with static and final variables.**\r\n\r\n76. **what are the use of static keyword in java ?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, static keyword is mainly used for memory management. It can be used with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. It is a keyword which is used to share the same variable or** **method of a given class. Basically, static is used for a constant variable or a method that is same for every instance of a class.**\r\n\r\n77. **what are the use of final keyword in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override). The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...). The final keyword is called a \"modifier\".**\r\n\r\n78. **what are the di\u0000erence between string, stringbuilder and stringbu\u0000er in java ?**\r\n\r\n    **String is immutable whereas StringBu\u0000er and StringBuilder are mutable classes. StringBu\u0000er is thread-safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not. That's why StringBuilder is faster than StringBu\u0000er.**\r\n\r\n79. **what is the di\u0000erence between == and .equals() method in java ?**\r\n\r\n    **Conclusion: So, the main di\u0000erence between \"==\" and \"equals\" in Java is that \"==\" compares the memory location of two objects, while \"equals\" compares the contents of two objects.**\r\n\r\n80. **What is OOPs Concept?**\r\n\r\n**Object-oriented programming is a core of Java Programming, which is used for designing a program using classes and objects. OOPs, can also be characterized as data controlling for accessing the code.**\r\n\r\n**-inheritance**\r\n\r\n**-encapsulation**\r\n\r\n**-polymorphism**\r\n\r\n**-abstraction**\r\n\r\n81. **what is class and object in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors – wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class. Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.**\r\n\r\n82. **what is inheritance in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system). The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.**\r\n\r\n83. **Types of Inheritance in Java : Single Inheritance.**\r\n\r\n    **Multi-Level Inheritance. Hierarchical Inheritance.**\r\n\r\n    **Hybrid Inheritance.**\r\n\r\n    **\\*Multiple Inheritance.**\r\n\r\n84. **what is polymorphism in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Polymorphism in Java is the task that performs a single action in di\u0000erent ways. So, languages that do not support polymorphism are not 'Object-Oriented Languages', but 'Object-Based Languages'. Ada, for instance, is one such language. Since Java supports polymorphism, it is an Object-Oriented Language.**\r\n\r\n85. **what is encapsulation in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Encapsulation in Java is the process by which data (variables) and the code that acts upon them (methods) are integrated as a** **single unit. By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes cannot access them, and only the methods of the class can access them.**\r\n\r\n86. **what is encapsulation in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Encapsulation in Java is the process by which data (variables) and the code that acts upon them (methods) are integrated as a single unit. By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes cannot access them, and only the methods of the class can access them.**\r\n\r\n87. **what is abstraction in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Abstraction in Java is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user and showing only the functionality to the user. It can be achieved by using abstract classes, methods, and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be inherited by concrete classes.**\r\n\r\n89. **public static void main(String[] args) method: -**\r\n\r\n**public: This means that the main method is accessible from anywhere in the program.**\r\n\r\n**static: This means that the main method does not belong to any particular object. It is a class method.**\r\n\r\n**void: This means that the main method does not return any value. main: This is the name of the method.**\r\n\r\n**String[] args: This is an array of strings that can be passed to the main method from the command line.**\r\n\r\n90. **What are the 8 primitive data types in Java?**\r\n\r\n**There are eight built-in primitive data types in Java. They are int, char, byte, short, long, float, double, and boolean.**\r\n\r\n91. **What is an exception in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Definition: An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.**\r\n\r\n92. **How to make object eligible for Garbage Collection ? Garbage Collection in Java-**\r\n\r\n    **Ways to make an object eligible for garbage collection in Java- By nullifying the reference variable-**\r\n\r\n    **By reassigning the reference variable-**\r\n\r\n    **By creating objects inside a method-**\r\n\r\n    **Island of Isolation-**\r\n\r\n93. **what is meant by java package ?**\r\n\r\n**A set of classes and interfaces grouped together are known as Packages in JAVA. The name itself defines that pack (group) of related types such as classes, sub-packages, enumeration, annotations, and interfaces that provide name-space management. Every class is a part of a certain package.**\r\n\r\n94. **what is user defined method in java ?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, a user-defined method is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called by other parts of the program. It is a way to modularize code and break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces.**\r\n\r\n95. **What is a NullPointerException in Java?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, a NullPointerException occurs when a variable that is being accessed has not yet been assigned to an object, in other words, the variable is assigned as null.**\r\n\r\n96. **what are jar files in java ?**\r\n\r\n**A JAR file, or Java Archive file, is a file format that is used to aggregate many files into one. It is a package file format that is typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution. JAR files are archive files that include a Java-specific manifest file.**\r\n\r\n**JAR files are used to store and distribute Java programs and libraries. They can also be used to store other types of files, such as configuration files and documentation.**\r\n\r\n97. **di\u0000erence between stack and heap memory in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) manages memory in two di\u0000erent areas: the stack and the heap. The stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure that is used to store local variables, method parameters, and return addresses. The heap is a**\r\n\r\n**free-form region of memory that is used to store object instances. The stack is a limited resource, and the JVM will throw a StackOverflowError if a method call causes the stack to overflow. The heap is not limited in size, but the JVM will throw an OutOfMemoryError if there is not enough free memory to allocate an object.**\r\n\r\n98. **what is lambda expression in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Lambda Expressions were added in Java 8. A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.**\r\n\r\n99. **what is functional interface in java ?**\r\n\r\n**An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as functional interface. It can have any number of default, static** **methods but can contain only one abstract method. It can also declare methods of object class. Functional Interface is also known as Single Abstract Method Interfaces or SAM Interfaces.**\r\n\r\n**100. what is method reference in java 8 ?**\r\n\r\n**Method reference is a new feature introduced in Java 8. It is a compact and easy form of the lambda expression. Method references are a special type of lambda expression. It is used to refer to a method of a functional interface.**\r\n\r\n**There are three types of method references in Java:**\r\n\r\n**-Reference to a static method**\r\n\r\n**-Reference to an instance method of a particular object -Reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type**\r\n\r\n**101. Why do we use optional in Java?**\r\n\r\n**Optional can help to prevent NullPointerException errors by making it explicit when a variable may or may not contain a value. This can lead to cleaner and more readable code. Optional provides several methods that can be used to safely work with data that may or may not be present.**\r\n\r\n**102. why stream api is required in java ?**\r\n\r\n**The Stream API is a powerful, but simple to understand set of tools for processing the sequence of elements. When used properly, it allows us to reduce a huge amount of boilerplate code, create more readable programs, and improve an app's productivity.**\r\n\r\n**Use of Stream in Java**\r\n\r\n**Stream API is a way to express and process collections of objects. Enable us to perform operations like filtering, mapping,reducing and sorting.**\r\n\r\n**103. what is collectors in java 8 ?**\r\n\r\n**A Collector is specified by four functions that work together to accumulate entries into a mutable result container, and optionally perform a final transform on the result. They are: creation of a new result container ( supplier() ) incorporating a new data element into a result container ( accumulator() )**\r\n\r\n**Java Stream collect() performs a mutable reduction operation on the elements of the stream. This is a terminal operation.**\r\n\r\n**104. what is the di\u0000erence between map and flatmap in java ? flatMap() is combination of a map() and a flattening operation. However, the di\u0000erence between map and flatmap is that flatmap() maps one input value multiple output values while map() maps to one value. flatMap() is an intermediate operation and return a new Stream or Optional.**\r\n\r\n**105.what is default method in interface in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Default methods enable you to add new functionality to existing interfaces and ensure binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces. In particular, default methods enable you to add methods that accept lambda expressions as parameters to existing interfaces.**\r\n\r\n**106. What does filter method return in Java 8?**\r\n\r\n**Java stream provides a method filter() to filter stream elements on the basis of given predicate. Suppose you want to get only even elements of your list then you can do this easily with the help** **of filter method. This method takes predicate as an argument and returns a stream of consisting of resulted elements.**\r\n\r\n**107. What are the core API classes for date and time in Java 8? Java 8 Date Time API Classes Examples**\r\n\r\n**LocalDate. LocalDate is an immutable class that represents Date with default format of yyyy-MM-dd. ...**\r\n\r\n**LocalTime. LocalTime is an immutable class whose instance represents a time in the human readable format. ... LocalDateTime. ...**\r\n\r\n**Instant.**\r\n\r\n**108. Can we add static method in interface Java 8?**\r\n\r\n**Java 8 brought a few brand new features to the table, including lambda expressions, functional interfaces, method references, streams, Optional, and static and default methods in interfaces. Prior to Java 8, we could have only method declarations in the interfaces. But from Java 8, we can have default methods and static methods in the interfaces.**\r\n\r\n**109. what is a consumer in java 8 ?**\r\n\r\n**A Consumer is an in-built functional interface in the java.util.function package. It was introduced in Java 8. We use consumers when we need to consume objects, the consumer takes an input value and returns nothing. The consumer interface has two methods:**\r\n\r\n**void accept(T value);**\r\n\r\n**default Consumer\u003cT\u003e andThen(Consumer\u003c? super T\u003e after);**\r\n\r\n**A Consumer is a functional interface that accepts a single input and returns no output. It can be used in all contexts where an object needs to be consumed, i.e. taken as input, and some** **operation is to be performed on the object without returning any result.**\r\n\r\n**110. what are some terminal operation example java 8 ? Terminal Operations: noneMatch, allMatch, collect, findAny, findFirst, anyMatch, toArray, reduce, min, max, forEach, collect, count etc.**\r\n\r\n**111. How to remove duplicates from list in Java 8?**\r\n\r\n**To remove duplicates from a list in Java, you can use a Set data structure. Sets only allow unique elements, so by adding the list to a Set, duplicates will automatically be removed.**\r\n\r\n**112. di\u0000erence between collection API and Strean API ?**\r\n\r\n**A collection is an in-memory data structure, which holds all the values that the data structure currently has—every element in the collection has to be computed before it can be added to the collection. In contrast, a stream is a conceptually fixed data structure in which elements are computed on demand.**\r\n\r\n**113. What is meant by wrapper class in Java?**\r\n\r\n**In Java, a wrapper class is a class that wraps one or more primitive data types. Wrapper classes are very common in java. For example, String, Integer and Boolean are wrapper classes. Wrapper classes are used to treat primitive data types as objects.**\r\n\r\n**114. What is the purpose of final finally and finalize in Java? final is a keyword used in Java to restrict the modification of a variable, method, or class. finally is a block used in Java to ensure that a section of code is always executed, even if an exception is thrown. finalize is a method in Java used to perform cleanup processing on an object before it is garbage collected.**\r\n\r\n**115. what is the di\u0000erence between arraylist and vector in java ? ArrayList is unsynchronized and not thread-safe, whereas Vectors are. Only one thread can call methods on a Vector, which is slightly overhead but helpful when safety is a concern. Therefore, in a single-threaded case, ArrayList is the obvious choice, but where multithreading is concerned, vectors are often preferable.**\r\n\r\n**116. what is the di\u0000erence between hashmap and hashtable in java ?**\r\n\r\n**HashMap allows one null key and values can be null whereas HashTable doesn't allow null key or value. HashMap is faster than HashTable. HashMap iterator is fail-safe where HashTable iterator is not fail-safe. HashMap extends AbstractMap class where HashTable extends Dictionary class.**\r\n\r\n**117. what is runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch in java ?**\r\n\r\n**Runtime polymorphism, also known as the Dynamic Method Dispatch, is a process that resolves a call to an overridden method at runtime. The process involves the use of the reference variable of a superclass to call for an overridden method.**\r\n\r\n**118. can you override a private or static method in java ?**\r\n\r\n**You cannot override a private or static method in Java. If you create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the super class method; this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in sub class because it's not accessible there.**\r\n\r\n**119. what is multiple inheritance and does java support ?**\r\n\r\n**Multiple inheritance in java is the capability of creating a single class with multiple superclasses. Unlike some other popular object oriented programming languages like C++, java doesn't provide support for multiple inheritance in classes.**\r\n\r\n**120. What is the di\u0000erence between GET and POST in Java HTTP? Data is transmitted in the header in HTTP GET. In HTTP POST, data is transmitted in the body. HTTP GET is less secure as details are visible in the URL bar. HTTP POST is more secure as details are not displayed in the URL bar.. what is di\u0000erence between get and post method in java?**\r\n\r\n**121. what is multithreading in java?**\r\n\r\n**Multithreading is a programming concept in which the application can create a small unit of tasks to execute in parallel. If you are working on a computer, it runs multiple applications and allocates processing power to them. A simple program runs in sequence and the code statements execute one by one.**\r\n\r\n**122. What is a Thread in Java?**\r\n\r\n**A thread in Java is the direction or path that is taken while a program is being executed. Generally, all the programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread, that is provided by the JVM or Java Virtual Machine at the starting of the program's execution.**\r\n\r\n**123. What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java with example?**\r\n\r\n**Threads in Java can be created in two fundamental ways: by extending the Thread class or by implementing the Runnable interface.**\r\n\r\n**124. how many types of thread are there in java ?**\r\n\r\n**two types**\r\n\r\n**There are two types of threads in an application - user thread and daemon thread. When we start an application, the main is the first user thread created. We can create multiple user threads as well as daemon threads. When all the user threads are executed, JVM terminates the program.**\r\n\r\n**125. what are the di\u0000erence between throw and throws in java ? The throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly. It can throw only one exception at a time. The throws keyword can be used to declare multiple exceptions, separated by a comma. Whichever exception occurs, if matched with the declared ones, is thrown automatically then.**\r\n\r\nTHANK-YOU\r\n"},{"slug":"JS-REACT-NEXT","title":"Important JS-REACT-NEXT question","excerpt":"Javascript,react and next-js is the most important programming language. for frontend development. You probably don't know it well enough!","image":"frontend.png","isFeatured":false,"date":"2024-08-21","content":"1. Callstack : -\r\n\r\nThe call stack is used by JavaScript to keep track of multiple function calls. It is like a real stack in data structures where data can be pushed and popped and follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. We use call stack for memorizing which function is running right now.\r\n\r\nView the Call Stack\r\n\r\nThis is useful when you have a lot of asynchronous functions, and you want to track the changes to the call stack while debugging an error. To view the call stack, open DevTools Sources panel and on the right panel, expand the Call Stack panel to see all the current functions in the call stack.\r\n\r\n2. Hoisting : -\r\n\r\nIn JavaScript, hoisting allows you to use functions and variables before they're declared.\r\n\r\nBy default, in JavaScript, Hoisting entails moving all declarations to the top of the scope before executing the code.\r\n\r\n3. Function : -\r\n\r\nfunction is a \"subprogram\" that can be called by code external (or internal, in the case of recursion) to the function.\r\n\r\n**Types of functions in javascript?**\r\n\r\n- Named function.\r\n- Anonymous function.\r\n- Immediately invoked function expression. It runs as soon as the browser finds it.\r\n4. Scope : -\r\n\r\nA scope can be defined as the region of the execution, a region where the expressions and values can be referenced. There are two scopes in JavaScript that are global and local: Global Scope: In the global scope, the variable can be accessed from any part of the JavaScript code.\r\n\r\n5. Let , var, const : -\r\n\r\nvar declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope.\r\n\r\n6 Closures : -\r\n\r\nA closure is a feature of JavaScript that allows inner functions to access the outer scope of a function. Closure helps in binding a function to its outer boundary and is created automatically whenever a function is created. A block is also treated as a scope since ES6.\r\n\r\n7. Set timeout : -\r\n\r\nThe setTimeout() method calls a function after a number of milliseconds.\r\n\r\n1 second = 1000 milliseconds.\r\n\r\nThe setTimeout() is executed only once\r\n\r\nIf you need repeated executions, use setInterval() instead Use the clearTimeout() method to prevent the function from starting.\r\n\r\n8. Anonymous function : -\r\n\r\nIt is a function that does not have any name associated with it. Normally we use the function keyword before the function name to define a function in JavaScript, however, in anonymous functions in JavaScript, we use only the function keyword without the function name.\r\n\r\n9. Promises , async \u0026 await : -\r\n\r\nAsync/Await is used to work with promises in asynchronous functions. It is basically syntactic sugar for promises. It is just a wrapper to\r\n\r\nrestyle code and make promises easier to read and use. It makes\r\n\r\nasynchronous code look more like synchronous/procedural code, which is easier to understand.\r\n\r\nPromise is an object representing intermediate state of operation which is guaranteed to complete its execution at some point in future. Async/Await is a syntactic sugar for promises, a wrapper making the code execute more synchronously. 2. Promise has 3 states – resolved, rejected and pending.\r\n\r\n10. Event loop : -\r\n\r\nThe event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.\r\n\r\nThe Basics of the Event Loop\r\n\r\nThis means that only one task can be executed at a time, and any blocking operation will prevent other tasks from being executed until the blocking operation is complete. To avoid blocking, JavaScript uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations\r\n\r\n11. Higher order function : -\r\n\r\nHigher order functions are functions that take one or more functions as arguments, or return a function as their result. In this article, we will delve into what a higher order function is, the benefits of using them, and how to use them in practical applications.\r\n\r\n12. Callback function : -\r\n\r\nA callback is a function passed as an argument to another function This technique allows a function to call another function\r\n\r\nA callback function can run after another function has finished\r\n\r\nA JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution. A more formal definition would be - Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.\r\n\r\n13. Callback hell : -\r\n\r\nCallback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. Every callback depends/waits for the previous callback, thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the readability and maintainability of the code.\r\n\r\n14. Promise chaining \u0026 error handling : -\r\n\r\nPromise Chaining is a simple concept by which we may initialize another promise inside our .then() method and accordingly we may execute our results. The function inside then captures the value returned by the previous promise.\r\n\r\nTo handle errors in Promises, use the . catch() method. If anything goes wrong with any of your promises, this method can catch the reason for that error. This time in our example, the error output is no longer 'uncaught' because of\r\n\r\n15. Prototype : -\r\n\r\nEvery object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype\r\n\r\nAll JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype:\r\n\r\n- Date objects inherit from Date.prototype\r\n- Array objects inherit from Array.prototype\r\n- Person objects inherit from Person.prototype\r\n16. Memoization : -\r\n\r\nMemoization is a programming technique that we used to speed up functions and it can be used to do whenever we have an expensive function ( takes a long time to execute). It relies on the idea of cache {}. A cache is just a plain object. It reduces redundant function expression calls. memoization is an optimization technique that makes\r\n\r\napplications more efficient and hence faster. It does this by\r\n\r\nstoring computation results in cache, and retrieving that same information from the cache the next time it's needed instead of\r\n\r\ncomputing it again.\r\n\r\n17. Event bubbling \u0026 event capturing : -\r\n\r\nThe \"Event Bubbling\" behavior makes it possible for you to handle an event in a parent element instead of the actual element that received the event. The pattern of handling an event on an ancestor element is called Event Delegation.\r\n\r\nBubbling is the default behavior, where events first trigger on the target element and then bubble up to its parent and ancestor elements. Capturing, on the other hand, triggers events on the ancestor elements first before reaching the target element.\r\n\r\n18. Data types : - (SNNUBO)\r\n\r\n    String\r\n\r\n    Number\r\n\r\n    Bigint\r\n\r\n    Boolean\r\n\r\n    Undefined\r\n\r\n    Null\r\n\r\n    Symbol\r\n\r\n    Object\r\n\r\n    The Object Datatype\r\n\r\n    The object data type can contain: 1. An object\r\n\r\n19. Function declaration and function expression : -\r\n\r\nA function expression is very similar to, and has almost the same syntax as, a function declaration. The main difference between a function expression and a function declaration is the function name, which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions.\r\n\r\nDeclarations are loaded before any code can run. Function declaration load before any code is executed while Function expressions load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the var statement, function declarations are hoisted to the top of other code.\r\n\r\n20. Cookies : -\r\n\r\nCookies are small pieces of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. They help that website remember information about your visit, which can both make it easier to visit the site again and make the site more useful to you.\r\n\r\nJavaScript Cookie class\r\n\r\nThe Cookie class has three static methods: get() , set() , and remove() .\r\n\r\nCookies are small pieces of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. They help that website remember information about your visit\r\n\r\n21. Imports \u0026 exports : -\r\n\r\nWith the help of ES6, we can create modules in JavaScript. In a module, there can be classes, functions, variables, and objects as well. To make all these available in another file, we can use export and import. The export and import are the keywords used for exporting and importing one or more members in a module\r\n\r\n22. Undefined , undeclared \u0026 null : -\r\n\r\n**Undefined:** It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a keyword.\r\n\r\n**Undeclared:** It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the *var* or *const keyword*. If we use *‘typeof’* operator to get the value of an undeclared variable, we will face the *runtime error* with the return value as **“undefined”**. The scope of the undeclared variables is always global.\r\n\r\nNull: a variable is assigned a value of like any other value. Is also primitive data type in javascript and always represent the intentional absence of a value.\r\n\r\n23. Remove duplicate from js array : -\r\n\r\nUsing filter method -\r\n\r\nconst arrayWithDuplicates = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];\r\n\r\nconst uniqueArray = arrayWithDuplicates.filter((value, index, self) =\u003e {\r\n\r\nreturn self.indexOf(value) === index;\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\nconsole.log(uniqueArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\n\r\n24. Spread operator vs rest operator : -\r\n\r\nThe spread operator in JavaScript expands values in arrays and strings into individual elements, whereas the rest operator puts the\r\n\r\nvalues of user-specified data into a JavaScript array.\r\n\r\nDestructuring is used to create varibles from array items or object properties. Spread syntax is used to unpack iterables such as arrays, objects, and function calls. Rest parameter syntax will create an array from an indefinite number of values.\r\n\r\n25. Shallow copy vs deep copy : -\r\n\r\nIn JavaScript, there are two ways to copy objects: shallow copy and deep copy. Shallow copying creates a new object with references to the same memory locations as the original object, while deep copying creates a new object with new memory locations for all of its properties and nested objects or arrays.\r\n\r\n26. This keyword : -\r\n\r\nIn JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object. Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called). The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used: In an object method, this refers to the object.\r\n\r\nThe this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name (because a class attribute is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter).\r\n\r\n27. Nan property : -\r\n\r\nIn JavaScript, NaN stands for Not a Number. It represents a value that is not a valid number. It can be used to check whether a number entered is a valid number or not a number.\r\n\r\n- Using isNaN() method: The isNan() method is used to check whether the given number is NaN or not. ...\r\n28. Map , filter \u0026 reduce : -\r\n\r\nThe map(), reduce() and filter() are array functions that transform the array according to the applied function and return the updated array.\r\n\r\nmap() transforms every element in an array individually and creates a new array.\r\n\r\nfilter() removes elements that are not required and creates\r\n\r\na new array containing the ones needed.\r\n\r\nreduce() reduces all array elements into a single value .\r\n\r\n29. Map \u0026 foreach : -\r\n\r\nThe map() method returns a new array, whereas the forEach() method does not return a new array. The map() method is used to transform the elements of an array, whereas the forEach() method is used to loop through the elements of an array.\r\n\r\n30. Event handling : -\r\n\r\nWhen javascript code is included in HTML, js react over these events and allow the execution. This process of reacting over the events is called Event Handling. Thus, js handles the HTML events via Event Handlers.\r\n\r\n31. Call , apply \u0026 bind : -\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between call, apply and bind functions? The main difference between the call, apply and bind functions is that the call function immediately invokes the function it is called on, whereas the apply and bind functions return a new function that can be invoked at a later time.\r\n\r\n**Call** is a function that helps you change the context of the\r\n\r\ninvoking function. In layperson's terms, it helps you replace the\r\n\r\nvalue of this inside a function with whatever value you want.\r\n\r\n**Apply** is very similar to the call function. The only difference is\r\n\r\nthat in apply you can pass an array as an argument list.\r\n\r\n**Bind** is a function that helps you create another function that\r\n\r\nyou can execute later with the new context of this that is\r\n\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\n32. For of , for in \u0026 for each : -\r\n\r\n**for..of** loop was introduced first in Javascript ES6 version. The for…of loop iterates over the iterable objects (like Array, Map, Set, arguments object, …,etc), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be\r\n\r\nexecuted for the value of each distinct property.\r\n\r\n**The for...in** statements combo iterates (loops) over the properties of an object. The code block inside the loop is executed once for each property.\r\n\r\n**The forEach()** array method loops through any array, executing a provided function once for each array element in ascending index order. This function is referred to as a callback function. Note: Arrays are collections of elements that can be of any datatype\r\n\r\nThe best use for these loops is as follows: For arrays, use for...of (or forEach ). For objects, use for...in . If you work with arrays and need access to indexes, use for or forEach .\r\n\r\n33. “==” , “ ===” : -\r\n\r\nThe main difference between the == and === operator in javascript is that the == operator does the type conversion of the operands before comparison, whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands.\r\n\r\n34. Array of object : -\r\n\r\nThe Array object lets you store multiple values in a single variable. It stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.\r\n\r\n35. Classes \u0026 objects : -\r\n\r\nClasses and Objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming that revolve around real-life entities.\r\n\r\nClasses: Classes were first introduced in the new version of the ES6 classes which replaced the previously used functions. Class is nothing but a blueprint for an object of it.\r\n\r\n36. Built in methods : -\r\n\r\nA JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. In other words, when the data stored on an object is a function we call that a method.\r\n\r\nTo differenciate between properties and methods, we can think of it this way: *A property is what an object has, while a method is what an object does.*\r\n\r\n- Useful Built-in methods\r\n- Date\r\n- Math\r\n- Strings\r\n- Arrays\r\n- Objects\r\n37. Document \u0026 window : -\r\n\r\nThe window is at a root/top level at the JavaScript object hierarchy. It is a global/root object in JavaScript and it is the root object of the Document object model(DOM); What is a JavaScript document? A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.\r\n\r\n38. Event capturing \u0026 event bubbling : -\r\n\r\nEvent capturing means propagation of event is done from ancestor elements to child element in the DOM while event bubbling means propagation is done from child element to ancestor elements in the DOM. The event capturing occurs followed by event bubbling.\r\n\r\nThe event needs to pass through every node on the DOM until it reaches the end, or if it is forcibly stopped. Bubbling and Capturing are the two phases of propagation. In their simplest definitions, bubbling travels from the target to the root, and capturing travels from the root to the target.\r\n\r\n39. Strict mode : -\r\n\r\nThe \"use strict\" directive enables JavaScript's strict mode. JavaScript's strict mode was introduced in ECMAScript 5. It enforces stricter parsing and error handling on the code at runtime. It also helps you write cleaner code and catch errors and bugs that might otherwise go unnoticed\r\n\r\n40. Dom : -\r\n\r\nThe Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.\r\n\r\nBy manipulating the DOM, you have infinite possibilities. You can create applications that update the data of the page without needing a refresh. Also, you can create applications that are customizable by the user and then change the layout of the page without a refresh. You can drag, move, and delete elements.\r\n\r\n41. Types of errors : -\r\n\r\nThere are 7 types of JavaScript errors: Syntax error, Reference Error, Type Error, Evaluation Error, RangeError, URI Error and Internal Error.\r\n\r\n42. IIFE : -\r\n\r\nAn IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that runs the moment it is invoked or called in the JavaScript event loop. Having a function that behaves that way can be useful in certain situations. IIFEs prevent pollution of the global JS scope.\r\n\r\n43. Temporal dead zone : -\r\n\r\nA temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer initializes it with a value. A block can be defined as a pair of braces ({...}) used to accumulate multiple statements. Initialization occurs when one assigns an initial value to a variable.\r\n\r\n44. Naming convention : -\r\n\r\nJavaScript variables should be declared using camel case, which means that the first word in the variable name starts with a lowercase letter, and subsequent words start with an uppercase letter. This convention ensures that there aren't multiple variables with the same name, which could lead to confusion and errors.\r\n\r\n45. Prompt box : -\r\n\r\nA prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page. When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either \"OK\" or \"Cancel\" to proceed after entering an input value. If the user clicks \"OK\" the box returns the input value. If the user clicks \"Cancel\" the box returns null.\r\n\r\n46. Currying : -\r\n\r\nCurrying in JavaScript transforms a function with multiple arguments into a nested series of functions, each taking a single argument. Currying helps you avoid passing the same variable multiple times, and it helps you create a higher order function\r\n\r\nWhy is currying useful in JavaScript? It helps us to create a higher-order function. It reduces the chances of error in our function by dividing it into multiple smaller functions that can handle one responsibility. It is very useful in building modular and reusable code.\r\n\r\n**-REACT-**\r\n\r\n1. WHAT IS REACT : -\r\n\r\nReact is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook which, among other things, was used to build Instagram.com. It aims to allow developers to create fast user interfaces for websites and applications alike easily. The main concept of React. js is virtual DOM.\r\n\r\n2. Advantage \u0026 disadvantage : -\r\n\r\nAdvantage :\r\n\r\n**Easy to Learn and USe**\r\n\r\n**Creating Dynamic Web Applications Becomes Easier Reusable Components**\r\n\r\n**Performance Enhancement**\r\n\r\n**The Support of Handy Tools**\r\n\r\n**Known to be SEO Friendly**\r\n\r\n**Scope for Testing the Codes**\r\n\r\nDisadvantage :\r\n\r\n**The high pace of development Poor Documentation**\r\n\r\n**View Part**\r\n\r\n**. JSX as a barrier**\r\n\r\n3. Role of react : -\r\n\r\nA React developer is responsible for the design and implementation of user interfaces (UIs) and UI components using React, a front-end JavaScript library. They develop and maintain UIs for web and mobile apps.\r\n\r\n4. Single page application (SPA) : -\r\n\r\nReact is a robust and widely-used JavaScript library for developing streamlined, interactive Single Page Applications (SPAs). Using React's fast virtual DOM and component-based design, developers can easily build sophisticated and responsive web apps\r\n\r\n5. React vs angular : -\r\n\r\nReact is a JavaScript library, whereas Angular is a front-end framework. React uses one-way data binding and virtual DOM, whereas Angular uses two-way data binding and real DOM. Moreover, React is faster than Angular as it has a smaller bundle size\r\n\r\n6. Real dom vs virtual dom : -\r\n\r\nDOM is a standard technology, while virtual DOM is only one implementation in the React framework.\r\n\r\nreal dom: here any change updates the entire dom updating therefore it is slow and inefficient.\r\n\r\nvirtual dom: any change only updates the relevant in the tree updating is fast and efficient.\r\n\r\n7. React component : -\r\n\r\nComponents are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components\r\n\r\n8. Npm : -\r\n\r\nThe name npm (Node Package Manager) stems from when npm first was created as a package manager for Node. js. All npm packages are defined in files called package. json. The content of package.\r\n\r\n9. Role of node modules folder : -\r\n\r\nIn simple word node\\_modules folder is the repository of modules/library which you are using inside your project. What ever you are importing in your project that module or library should present inside the node\\_module folder\r\n\r\n10. Role of public folder : -\r\n\r\nThe public folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases: You need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as manifest.webmanifest . You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths. You want to include a small script like pace.js outside of the bundled code\r\n\r\n11. Role of src folder : -\r\n\r\nIn the src folder, You can put all the js, CSS, images, components file \u0026 other assets of your projects. By default, we get the following files that are necessary to understand their usages. you can create your own files according to these files for developing your projects\r\n\r\n12. Role of index.html page : -\r\n\r\npublic/index. html is the main HTML file of our app that includes your React code and provides a context for React to render to. If you look at the html file you could see \u003cdiv id=\"root\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e . We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM\r\n\r\n13. Role of app.js file : -\r\n\r\njs is where you would usually mount/render your main react component onto your “root” element(which you mark in your html). “App” is what people tend to call the file which contains the main logic of your file, or in React case, the main component, the one that represents your entire application/web-site\r\n\r\n14. Role of index.js file : -\r\n\r\nRegarding React, index. js is where you would usually mount/render your main react component onto your “root” element(which you mark in your html)\r\n\r\n15. Render method : -\r\n\r\nWe can use the ReactDOM. render() in the application using the declaration of HTML code and the HTML element. The goal of this function is to represent the imposed HTML code within the specified HTML element tags. It helps to redirect the HTML page with the help of the render() function\r\n\r\nrender() method\r\n\r\nThe render() method is the only required method in a class component. When called, it should examine this.props and this.state and return one of the following types: React elements.\r\n\r\n16. How react app load and display the component in browser : -\r\n\r\n    React takes a different approach by letting you build what's known as a single-page application (SPA). A single-page application loads only a single HTML document on the first request. Then, it updates the specific portion, content, or body of the webpage that needs updating using JavaScript Open the console by either right-clicking and inspecting an element or by opening the toolbar by clicking View \u003e Developer \u003e JavaScript console. The Components tab will show the current React component tree, along with any props, state, or context.\r\n\r\n17. Jsx : -\r\n\r\nJSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.\r\n\r\n18. Advantage of jsx : -\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of JSX is that React creates a virtual DOM (a virtual representation of the page) to track changes and updates. Instead of rewriting the entire HTML, React modifies the DOM of the page whenever the information is updated. This is one of the main issues React was created to solve.\r\n\r\n19. Babel : -\r\n\r\nBabel is a JavaScript compiler that converts modern JavaScript code into a version compatible with all browsers. Babel enables React developers to use the latest JavaScript syntax in their components. Babel transpiles modern JavaScript for use in React components and all browsers.\r\n\r\n20. Transpiler : -\r\n\r\nBabel in react operates as a transpiler, converting the latest JavaScript syntax into a version that can run in all environments. This is done by converting the latest JavaScript syntax into an older version that is supported by all browsers.\r\n\r\n21. Fragment : -\r\n\r\nReact Fragment is a feature in React that allows you to return multiple elements from a React component by allowing you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. To return multiple elements from a React component, you'll need to wrap the element in a root element.\r\n\r\n22. how do you iterate over a list in jsx react ?\r\n\r\nUsing the map() Method\r\n\r\nThe map() method is the most commonly used function to iterate over an array of data in JSX. You can attach the map() method to the array and pass a callback function that gets called for each iteration. When rendering the User component, pass a unique value to the key prop.\r\n\r\n23. Map method : -\r\n\r\nMap is a type of data structure or data collection that is used to store the data in the form of key and value pairs. Each pair has a unique key in a map, and the value stored in each pair must be mapped to its unique key.\r\n\r\nThe map() function is used to iterate over an array and manipulate or change data items. In React, the map() function is most commonly used for rendering a list of data to the DOM.\r\n\r\n24. Props in jsx : -\r\n\r\nReact Props. Props stand for \"Properties.\" They are read-only components. It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. It gives a way to pass data from one component to other components. It is similar to function arguments.\r\n\r\n**Using Props in React**\r\n\r\n- Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)\r\n- Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props.\r\n- Finally, render the Props Data.\r\n\r\nProps are used to store data that can be accessed by the children of a React component. They are part of the concept of reusability. Props take the place of class attributes and allow you to create consistent interfaces across the component hierarchy.\r\n\r\n25. Spread operator : -\r\n\r\nIn the context of React, the spread operator can be used to spread an object of props onto an element in a React component, making it easier to pass down props to child components but more on that later!\r\n\r\nThe main difference between rest and spread is that the rest operator puts the rest of some specific user-supplied values into a JavaScript array. But the spread syntax expands iterables into individual elements.\r\n\r\n26. methods for conditional rendering in react:-\r\n- if/else.\r\n- Ternary operation.\r\n- Inline IF with Logical \u0026\u0026 operator.\r\n- Switch case operator.\r\n- Conditional Rendering with enums.\r\n- Higher-Order Components.\r\n27. React context : -\r\n\r\nReact Context is a method to pass props from parent to child component(s), by storing the props in a store(similar in Redux) and using these props from the store by child component(s) without actually passing them manually at each level of the component tree.\r\n\r\n28. Prop drilling : -\r\n\r\nProp drilling occurs when a parent component passes data down to its children and then those children pass the same data down to their own children. This process can continue indefinitely.\r\n\r\nProp drilling occurs when you need to pass down data through multiple nested components to reach the ones that require the data. This practice can lead to a complex and tightly coupled component hierarchy, making it challenging to manage state and refactor your application.\r\n\r\n29. Control and uncontrolled component : -\r\n\r\nIn React, controlled components refer to components that have their state and behavior controlled by the parent component. These components rely on props passed down from the parent component to update their state and behavior. Uncontrolled components refer to components that manage their own state internally.\r\n\r\nIn a controlled component react, state handles all the form data, whereas, in an uncontrolled component, the HTML form element data is managed by only the DOM. If you are using a controlled component, you are in control of your form input values. The developer can decide what to insert or not and where to insert it.\r\n\r\n30. What is React extension?\r\n\r\nReact Developer Tools is a Chrome DevTools extension for the open-source React JavaScript library. It allows you to inspect the React component hierarchies in the Chrome Developer Tools.\r\n\r\n31. Event : -\r\n\r\nAn event is an action that could be triggered as a result of the user action or system generated event. For example, a mouse click, loading of a web page, pressing a key, window resizes, and other interactions are called events.\r\n\r\nBasic Event Handling\r\n\r\nYou need to use the specific React version, otherwise you get a compile error. Events supported are: AnimationEvent , ChangeEvent , ClipboardEvent , CompositionEvent , DragEvent , FocusEvent , FormEvent , KeyboardEvent , MouseEvent , PointerEvent , TouchEvent , TransitionEvent , WheelEvent .\r\n\r\n32. State : -\r\n\r\nReact components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belong to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.\r\n\r\n33. Higher order and pure component : -\r\n\r\n**Higher-order components (HOCs)** are a powerful feature of the React library. They allow you to reuse component logic across multiple components. In React, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component that wraps the original component.\r\n\r\n**React pure components** are the components that do not re-render when the value of props and state has been updated with the same values. Since these components do not cause re-rendering when the same values are passed thus they improve performance.\r\n\r\n34 routing : -\r\n\r\nRouting in reactJS is the mechanism by which we navigate through a website or web-application. Routing can be server-side routing or client-side routing. However, React Router is a part of client-side routing.\r\n\r\n35. React router : -\r\n\r\nReact Router is a JavaScript framework that lets us handle client and server-side routing in React applications. It enables the creation of single-page web or mobile apps that allow navigating without refreshing the page. It also allows us to use browser history features while preserving the right application view.\r\n\r\n36. Life cycle method : -\r\n- Mounting. These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM: …componentDidMount()\r\n- Updating. An update can be caused by changes to props or state. …componentDidUpdate()\r\n- Unmounting. This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM: …componentWillUnmount()\r\n- Error Handling.\r\n37. Interceptors : -\r\n\r\nInterceptors allow you to modify the request or response before it is sent or received by the server. Interceptors are useful because they allow developers to add custom functionality to requests and responses without modifying the actual code that makes the request.\r\n\r\n38. Refs in react : -\r\n\r\nRefs are a function provided by React to access the DOM element and the React element that you might have created on your own. They are used in cases where we want to change the value of a child component, without making use of props and all. They have wide functionality as we can use callbacks with them\r\n\r\nRefs are a function that use to access the DOM from components. You only need to attach a ref to the element in your application to provide access to it from anywhere within your component without making use of props and all. We can also use Refs to direct access to React elements and use callbacks with them.\r\n\r\n39. Element vs component : -\r\n\r\nA React element is an object representation of a DOM node. A component encapsulates a DOM tree. Elements are immutable i,e once created cannot be changed. The state in a component is mutable.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly a difference between elements and components. Furthermore, a component refers to a small part of a larger entity that mostly is a manufactured object. In contrast, an element is one the simplest parts of which anything consists of.\r\n\r\n40. Class base vs function base component : -\r\n\r\nA functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX). A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function that returns a React element. There is no render method used in functional components.\r\n\r\nFunction components allow you to use Hooks. That means you can use additional functionality and make it easier to manage state and side effects.\r\n\r\n41. Hooks : -\r\n\r\nHooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed. Although Hooks generally replace class components, there are no plans to remove classes from React.\r\n\r\n42. Usestate hook : -\r\n\r\nuseState is React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component. It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it. The Hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an updated state value whenever the setter function is called.\r\n\r\n43. Useeffect hook : -\r\n\r\nThe useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components. Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers. useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.\r\n\r\n44. Usecontext hook : -\r\n\r\nThe useContext Hook provides function components access to the context value for a context object. It: Takes the context object (i.e., value returned from React. createContext ) as the one argument it accepts. And returns the current context value as given by the nearest context provider\r\n\r\n45. Useref hook : -\r\n\r\nThe useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. It can be used to access a DOM element directly.\r\n\r\n46. Usereducer hook : -\r\n\r\nThe useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook. It allows for custom state logic. If you find yourself keeping track of multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic, useReducer may be useful.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the main advantage of using the useReducer() is that it allows us to manage complex state changes in a single, centralized place. We can define all of our state updates and actions in the reducer() function, making it easier to maintain and debug our application.\r\n\r\n47. Usememo hook : -\r\n\r\nThe React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value. Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated. The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update. This can improve performance. The useMemo and useCallback Hooks are similar.\r\n\r\nThe React hooks useMemo take two arguments in its parameter. These arguments are an array of dependencies and some functions whose output you want to cache. By default, the useMemo hook will execute the function you passed as an argument after the initial render.\r\n\r\n48. Custom hook : -\r\n\r\nCustom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic (such as setting up a subscription and remembering the current value), but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated\r\n\r\nHooks are reusable functions. When you have component logic that needs to be used by multiple components, we can extract that logic to a custom Hook. Custom Hooks start with \"use\". Example: useFetch .\r\n\r\n49. Lazy loading : -\r\n\r\nLazy loading is a technique for waiting to load certain parts of a webpage — especially images — until they are needed. Instead of loading everything all at once, known as \"eager\" loading, the browser does not request certain resources until the user interacts in such a way that the resources are needed.\r\n\r\n50. Arrow function : -\r\n\r\nArrow functions offer a compressed and short version of a function expression and need fewer keystrokes than regular JavaScript functions from the developer and can be used as a simpler alternative to functions within class components and functional components and event handlers in React\r\n\r\n51. Props vs state : -\r\n\r\nProps are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, while state is used to manage data within a component. Props are immutable and cannot be changed within a component, while state is mutable and can be updated using the setState function.\r\n\r\n52. can ajax is used with react ?\r\n\r\nYou can use any AJAX library you like with React. Some popular ones are Axios, jQuery AJAX, and the browser built-in window. Fetch.\r\n\r\nThe core function of Ajax is to asynchronously update web content, justifying the “A” of AJAX. This means a user's web browser doesn't need to refresh the entire web page while changing a small portion of the content on the page. So, there is no need for a page reload or a postback.\r\n\r\nWe need to call APIs from a remote endpoint to access external resources, which we can do using Ajax to configure the request and respond to the resources.\r\n\r\n53. Synthetic event : -\r\n\r\nThe react event handling system is known as Synthetic Events. The synthetic event is a cross-browser wrapper of the browser's native event. Handling events with react have some syntactic differences from handling events on DOM. These are: React events are named as camelCase instead of lowercase.\r\n\r\n54. Stateful component \u0026 stateless component : -\r\n\r\nThe difference between stateful and stateless is that one has state, and the other doesn't. That means the stateful components are keeping track of changing data, while stateless components print out what is given to them via props, or they always render the same thing.\r\n\r\nThe answer is performance. Stateless functional components can be rendered faster. One of the reasons why this is the case is because stateless functional components do not require some of the life cycle hooks.\r\n\r\n55. Disadvantage of using MVC in react : -\r\n\r\nOne of the drawbacks of MVC is that it can increase the complexity and overhead of your code. Because you have to create and manage three components, you may end up with more files, classes, and functions than necessary. This can make your code harder to debug and refactor.\r\n\r\n56. Keys : -\r\n\r\nA “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. Keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists.\r\n\r\n57. What is the second argument that can optionally be passed to setState and what is its purpose ?\r\n\r\n    The second argument that can optionally be passed to setState is a callback function which gets called immediately after the setState is completed and the components get re-rendered.\r\n\r\n58. Strict mode : -\r\n\r\nStrictMode is a tool that highlights potential issues in a programme. It works by encapsulating a portion of your full application as a component. StrictMode does not render any visible elements in the DOM in development mode, but it enables checks and gives warnings.\r\n\r\n59. React fiber : -\r\n\r\nReact Fiber is a backwards compatible, complete rewrite of the React core. In other words, it is a reimplementation of older versions of the React reconciler. Introduced from React 16, Fiber Reconciler is the new reconciliation algorithm in React.\r\n\r\nGoals of React Fiber: Fiber focuses on animations and responsiveness. It has the ability to split work into chunks and prioritize tasks. We can pause work and come back to it later. We can also reuse previously completed work or maybe abort it if it is not needed\r\n\r\n60\\.Error boundary : -\r\n\r\nError boundaries in React are a crucial aspect of error handling in React applications. They are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.\r\n\r\nTo handle errors, wrap components with the error boundary class component. You can wrap the top-level component or individual components. If you wrap the top-level component, the error boundary class will handle the errors thrown by all the components in the React application\r\n\r\n61. Optimize react app performance : -\r\n- Minimize the number of re-renders. ...\r\n- Use the production build. ...\r\n- Code-splitting. ...\r\n- Lazy loading. ...\r\n- Avoid using inline styles. ...\r\n- Use the React DevTools profiler. ...\r\n- Optimize images and other assets.\r\n62. Reconciliation : -\r\n\r\nReconciliation is the process by which React updates the UI to reflect changes in the component state. The reconciliation algorithm is the set of rules that React uses to determine how to update the UI in the most efficient way possible. React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to update the UI.\r\n\r\n63. How does React rendering works?\r\n\r\nAfter you trigger a render, React calls your components to figure out what to display on screen. “Rendering” is React calling your components. On initial render, React will call the root component. For subsequent renders, React will call the function component whose state update triggered the render.\r\n\r\n64. Unidirectional data flow : -\r\n\r\nReact, a Javascript library, uses unidirectional data flow. The data from the parent is known as props. You can only transfer data from parent to child and not vice versa. This means that the child components cannot update or modify the data on their own, makeing sure that a clean data flow architecture is followed.\r\n\r\n65. Mounting : -\r\n\r\nMounting is the initial phase in which the instance of the component is created and inserted into the DOM. When the component gets successfully inserted into the DOM, the component is said to be mounted. In the updating phase, the component gets updated while being present in the DOM\r\n\r\n66. Way to call api : -\r\n\r\nAn API call in React refers to making a request to a web API from a React application. We can make an API call with: XMLHttpRequest, Fetch API or Axios.\r\n\r\n67. React context api : -\r\n\r\nThe React Context API, introduced in React v. 16.3, allows us to pass data through our component trees, giving our components the ability to communicate and share data at different levels.\r\n\r\n68. Event pooling : -\r\n\r\nEvents in React are pooled, this means that the SyntheticEvent object will be reused and all properties will be nullified after the event handler has been called. In simpler terms, as soon as the eventHandler is done with its job, the same event object will be recycled and made new for handling other events.\r\n\r\n69. Set state () : -\r\n\r\nsetState() allows you to change state in a React class component. To change the state of a function component, you use the useState() hook. Learn more about it here. setState() enqueues change to the component state and tell React that this component and its children need to be re-rendered with the updated state.\r\n\r\n\\- -NEXT.JS- -\r\n\r\n1\\.WHAT IS NEXT JS ?\r\n\r\nNext.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications. By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.\r\n\r\n2. FEATURES : -\r\n\r\nNext.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications. By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.\r\n\r\n- Data Fetching.

ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE : -\r\n\r\nThe benefits of using Next. js in developing websites are adaptability and responsiveness, security, shorter load time, improved SEO, a faster development process, and better image optimisation.\r\n\r\nLimitations of Using NextJS\r\n\r\nIt's a file-based router, which means that it's a file system and uses files to deal with responses and requests. Sometimes these file projects aren't sufficient for some projects. To create or use the dynamic routes, you need to have NodeJS in hand, which requires proficient developers.\r\n\r\n4. Server Components \u0026 Client Components : -\r\n\r\nServer Component is a component that is fetched and rendered ON THE SERVER, while Client Component is the one that is fetched and rendered ON THE CLIENT(browser).\r\n\r\nReact Server Components allow you to write UI that can be rendered and optionally cached on the server. In Next.js, the rendering work is further split by route segments to enable streaming and partial rendering, and there are three different server rendering strategies: Static Rendering.\r\n\r\n5. Routing types : -\r\n\r\nfile-system based router\r\n\r\nNext.js uses a file-system based router where folders are used to define routes. Each folder represents a route segment that maps to a URL segment. To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other.\r\n\r\n6. Default component : -\r\n\r\nBy default, Next.js uses Server Components. This allows you to automatically implement server rendering with no additional configuration, and you can opt into using Client Components when you needed,\r\n\r\n7. Can we use event in server component ?\r\n\r\nif you want to use event handlers you have to add 'use client'; at the top of your component file because the node. js server that renders the server components for create static version of your app knows nothing about browser APIs like DOM\r\n\r\n8. Middleware : -\r\n\r\nMiddleware in Next. js is a piece of code that allows you to perform actions before a request is completed and modify the response accordingly. It bridges the incoming request and your application, providing flexibility and control over the request/response flow.\r\n\r\n9. Environment variable : -\r\n\r\nEnvironment variables in Next. js are a way to set configuration values that are used by your application. They can be used to store data such as the name of your company, the port your application will run on, or any other configuration values you need.\r\n\r\n10. Why server component better for seo ?\r\n\r\njs has a pre-rendering feature that the HTML supposed to render is produced on the server-side then sent to the client-side. This pre-rendering feature provides improved SEO for the Next. js application because the search engine will get HTML directly from the server and doesn't require generating HTML while crawling.\r\n\r\n11. How can custom error page created in next js ?\r\n\r\nTo create a custom 404 page, you first need to create a “404. js” named file in your pages directory. This file is statically generated at build time. In this page create and export a custom component and the rest will be taken care of by Next Js\r\n\r\n12. Benefits of implementing a serverless model :-\r\n\r\nServerless deployment dramatically improves reliability and scalability by splitting your application into smaller parts (also called lambdas). In the case of Next. js, each page in the pages directory becomes a serverless lambda\r\n\r\nThe Serverless Framework enables developers to quickly configure and deploy their applications. It provides developers with the ability to customize events, functions, and triggers, as well as the resources required to run their applications\r\n\r\n13. SSR : -\r\n\r\nSSR or Server Side Rendering is also known as dynamic rendering. In SSR the page is generated each time the server gets a request. Pages on which the data have to change for a particular type of request, those pages use SSR as data is not the same for every request and may vary with it.\r\n\r\nSSR brings several benefits to Next. js applications: Improved SEO: SSR enables search engines to easily crawl and index our pages, leading to better search engine rankings and visibility. Faster initial page load: Pre-rendered HTML is sent from the server, resulting in shorter load times and a better user experience.\r\n\r\n14. STYLED JSX IN NEXT JS : -\r\n\r\nStyled JSX is a CSS-in-JS library that lets you write encapsulated and scoped CSS to style your components. The styles you make for one component won't impact other's features. Allowing you to add, modify and delete styles without stressing unintended side effects.\r\n\r\n15. Automatic code splitting : -\r\n\r\nCode-splitting is the process of splitting the application's bundle into smaller chunks required by each entry point. The goal is to improve the application's initial load time by only loading the code required to run that page.\r\n\r\nNext.js has built-in support for code splitting. Each file inside your pages/ directory will be automatically code split into its own JavaScript bundle during the build step. Further: Any code shared between pages is also split into another bundle to avoid re-downloading the same code on further navigation.\r\n\r\n16. Frontend or backend ?\r\n\r\nNext. js is a React framework that makes building powerful full stack (front end + back end) applications a lot easier. The team behind Next. js recently released Next\r\n\r\n17. Dom : -\r\n\r\nReact uses a virtual DOM that is a JavaScript representation of the actual DOM. This allows React to update only the components that have changed, which makes React apps faster. Next. js also uses a virtual DOM, but it also builds on React to provide additional features that can make Next\r\n\r\n18. Imperative and declarative programming : -\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to explain the difference between declarative and imperative code, would be that imperative code focuses on writing an explicit sequence of commands to describe how you want the computer to do things, and declarative code focuses on specifying the result of what you want.\r\n\r\n19. Types of prerendring : -\r\n\r\nNext.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **[Static Generation**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended)** and **[Server-side Rendering**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering)**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.\r\n\r\n- [**Static Generation**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then *reused* on each request.\r\n- [**Server-side Rendering**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.\r\n20. Default prerender : -\r\n\r\nBy default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means that Next.js *generates HTML for each page in advance*, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization).\r\n\r\nEach generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive. (This process is called **hydration**.)\r\n\r\n21. Main scripts : -\r\n\r\nNextjs Script component is one of them. In nextjs Script component help to add third-party javascript like google Adsense, google analytics, stripe, tailwind CSS, and many more. Nextjs automatically optimize your app with the nextjs script component. You do not worry about configuration and other stuff.\r\n\r\n22. Method for fetching data : -\r\n\r\nServer-Side Data Fetching \r\n\r\nNext. js provides two functions, getStaticProps and getServerSideProps , for server-side data fetching during the rendering process. These functions allow you to fetch data from an API or a database and pass it as props to your page components\r\n\r\n23. getinitial props() : -\r\n\r\ngetInitialProps is a special function provided by Next. js that runs on the server side before rendering a page. This function allows you to fetch data from an external API, database, or any other data source, and pass it as props to your React components.\r\n\r\n24. Key feature of seo : -\r\n\r\nNext. js provides better SEO performance by rendering web pages on the server (server-side) instead of rendering in the browser (client-side). Server-side rendering allows search engine crawlers and bots to scan and index web pages, detect metadata, and properly understand the information a website contains\r\n\r\nSEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. The goal of SEO is to create a strategy that will increase your rankings position in search engine results. The higher the ranking, the more organic traffic to your site, which ultimately leads to more business for you!\r\n\r\n25. How build id be configured ?\r\n\r\nNext. js uses a constant id generated at build time to identify which version of your application is being served. This can cause problems in multi-server deployments when next build is run on every server. In order to keep a consistent build id between builds you can provide your own build id.\r\n\r\nTo configure the build-id in Next. js , we must configure a static ID between our builds. So, we have to provide the \" generateBuildId \" function with the following configuration.\r\n\r\n26. AMP first page method : -\r\n\r\nThe page is automatically optimized with AMP Optimizer , an optimizer that applies the same transformations as AMP caches (improves performance by up to 42%) The page has a user-accessible (optimized) version of the page and a search-engine indexable (unoptimized) version of the page\r\n\r\n27. Hybrid amp first page method : -\r\n\r\nThe page is rendered as traditional HTML (default) and AMP HTML (by adding ? amp=1 to the URL) The AMP version of the page only has valid optimizations applied with AMP Optimizer so that it is indexable by search-engines.\r\n\r\n28. How cdn be setup ?\r\n\r\nTo set up a CDN , you can set up an asset prefix and configure your CDN's origin to resolve to the domain that Next. js is hosted on. The exact configuration for uploading your files to a given CDN will depend on your CDN of choice. The only folder you need to host on your CDN is the contents of .\r\n\r\nIn Next. js, since pre-rendering can be done ahead of time, CDNs are well suited to store the static result of the work - making content delivery faster.\r\n\r\n29. What is the alternative to Next.js framework?\r\n\r\nWell, there are quite a few options for you to explore! Some popular ones are Gatsby, Nuxt. js, and Sapper/SvelteKit. Each of these frameworks has its own unique features and capabilities, but they all serve the purpose of creating fast, modern web applications.\r\n\r\n30. Is Next.js written in TypeScript?\r\n\r\nNext.js provides a TypeScript-first development experience for building your React application. It comes with built-in TypeScript support for automatically installing the necessary packages and configuring the proper settings.\r\n\r\n**THANK YOU -**\r\n"},{"slug":"NODE-EXPRESS-MONGO","title":"Important NODE-EXPRESSS-MONGODB question","excerpt":"Node,express and mongodb is the most important programming language for backend development. You probably don't know it well enough!","image":"backend.png","isFeatured":false,"date":"2024-08-21","content":"\r\n1. What is node js ?\r\n\r\nNode. js is a single-threaded, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for building fast and scalable server-side and networking applications. It runs on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, and it uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture, which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.\r\n\r\n2. Features : -\r\n- Single Threaded. Node. ...\r\n- Asynchronous. Node. ...\r\n- Event Driven. The event-driven concept is similar to the concept of a callback function in asynchronous programming. ...\r\n- Open Source. Node. ...\r\n- Performance. ...\r\n- Highly Scalable. ...\r\n- Node Package Manager(NPM) ...\r\n- No Buffering.\r\n3. Advantage \u0026 disadvantage : -\r\n\r\nIts event-driven nature, microservices architecture, and MongoDB support allows businesses to grow and scale their products easily. However, be careful with heavy CPU bound tasks, as Node. js can reduce the performance of your application\r\n\r\n4. Node vs javascript : -\r\n\r\nNodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment. Javascript is a computer programming language that is used to build scripts for websites. With the support of NodeJS, Javascript can be executed outside of the browser. Only browsers are capable of running Javascript.\r\n\r\n5. Uses and benefits : -\r\n\r\nNode. js allows programmers to develop server-side JavaScript and frontend JavaScript codes with simplicity. One of the major node. js advantages is that it eliminates the need for two resource teams, saving time, money, and energy for overall project development.\r\n\r\n6. Node vs angular : -\r\n\r\nThe Angular features allow programmers to build interactive, client-side web applications, making the framework widely used by JavaScript developers nowadays. Node. js, on the other hand, is mainly used by JavaScript developers to create fast \u0026 scalable networking and server-side applications.\r\n\r\n7. Why node is single threaded : -\r\n\r\nNode. js is Single Threaded, i.e. it executes the code in a single sequence or direction. At a given time, only a single task/ call is executed. Asynchronous and Single-Threaded: Execution doesn't wait for the current request to complete and moves to the next request/call\r\n\r\n8. Different api function : -\r\n\r\n**The two types of API functions in Node.js are:**\r\n\r\n- Asynchronous, non-blocking functions.\r\n- Synchronous, blocking functions.\r\n9. Synchronous and asynchronous function : -\r\n\r\nAsynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously. Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation is dependent on the completion of the one before it.\r\n\r\n10. Control flow function : -\r\n\r\nA control flow function is a lightweight, generic piece of code which runs in between several asynchronous function calls and which take care of the necessary housekeeping to: control the order of execution, collect data, limit concurrency and.\r\n\r\n11. Event loop : -\r\n\r\nAn event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them, and then sleeps until it receives more tasks. The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task. The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.\r\n\r\nNode. js has two types of threads: one Event Loop and k Workers. The Event Loop is responsible for JavaScript callbacks and non-blocking I/O, and a Worker executes tasks corresponding to C++ code that completes an asynchronous request, including blocking I/O and CPU-intensive work.\r\n\r\n12. Order of execution in control flow statement : -\r\n\r\n**These are following the order in which control flow statements are used to process function calls:**\r\n\r\n- Handling execution and queue.\r\n- Data collection and storage.\r\n- Concurrency handling and limiting.\r\n- Execution of the next piece of code.\r\n\r\nControl flow in Node. js is typically managed using one of three methods: callbacks, promises, and async/await. 1. Callbacks: Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when that function completes its task.\r\n\r\n13. Event based model : -\r\n\r\nNode. js uses event driven programming. It means as soon as Node starts its server, it simply initiates its variables, declares functions and then simply waits for event to occur. It is the one of the reason why Node. js is pretty fast compared to other similar technologies.\r\n\r\n14. Ajax vs node : -\r\n\r\nNode. js allows code to be written on the server side. AJAX is apart of the front-end of website development. This means that you can use AJAX to send off requests to the server, but node can be written to process those requests and shoot back responses.\r\n\r\n15. Framework : -\r\n\r\nExpress.js Meteor\r\n\r\nSails.js Angular\r\n\r\nNext.js\r\n\r\n16. Test pyramid : -\r\n\r\nThe test pyramid in Node. js is a conceptual model that guides software developers in structuring their test suites. It emphasizes a balanced distribution of different types of tests, such as unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.\r\n\r\n17. Libuv : -\r\n\r\nLibuv is a library written in the programming language C that helps nodejs to improve efficiency while running tasks parallelly. However, nodejs already have async API's. It uses Libuvs's thread pools if async API is not available in nodejs and processes are blocking the operations.\r\n\r\n18. Spawn vs fork method : -\r\n\r\nFork creates a child process that is a copy of the parent process, while spawn creates a new process from scratch. Exec is typically used for short-lived processes, while fork and spawn are typically used for long-lived processes\r\n\r\n19. Middleware : -\r\n\r\nThe middleware in node. js is a function that will have all the access for requesting an object, responding to an object, and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of the middleware is to modify the req and res objects, and then compile and execute any code that is required. It also helps to terminate the request-response session and call for the next middleware in the stack.\r\n\r\n20. Global object : -\r\n\r\nNode. js Global Objects are the objects that are available in all modules. Global Objects are built-in objects that are part of the JavaScript and can be used directly in the application without importing any particular module.\r\n\r\n21. Assert : -\r\n\r\nThe assert module provides a way of testing expressions. If the expression evaluates to 0, or false, an assertion failure is being caused, and the program is terminated. This module was built to be used internally by Node.\r\n\r\nThe assert() method tests if a given expression is true or not. If the expression evaluates to 0, or false, an assertion failure is being caused, and the program is terminated. The assert() method is an alias of the assert. ok() method.\r\n\r\n22. Stubs : -\r\n\r\nStubs are functions or programs that affect the behavior of components or modules. Stubs are dummy objects for testing. Stubs implement a pre-programmed response.\r\n\r\n23. Buffer class : -\r\n\r\nThe Buffer class in Node. js is used to perform operations on raw binary data. Generally, Buffer refers to the particular memory location in memory. Buffer and array have some similarities, but the difference is array can be any type, and it can be resizable.\r\n\r\nIn Node Js, buffers are used to store raw binary data. A buffer represents a\r\n\r\nchunk of memory that is allocated on our computer. The size of the buffer, once set, cannot be changed. A buffer is used to store bytes.\r\n\r\n24. Why express js used ?\r\n\r\nExpress is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes\r\n\r\n25. Connect module : -\r\n\r\nConnect-flash module for Node. js allows the developers to send a message whenever a user is redirecting to a specified web-page.\r\n\r\n26. Streams : -\r\n\r\nA stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. The node:stream module provides an API for implementing the stream interface. There are many stream objects provided by Node.js. For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.\r\n\r\nStreams are objects that allows developers to read/write data to and from a source in a continuous manner. There are four main types of streams in Node. js; readable, writable, duplex and transform. Each stream is an eventEmitter instance that emits different events at several intervals.\r\n\r\n27. Use of repl : -\r\n\r\nNote: REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop, and it is a programming language environment (basically a console window) that takes single expression as user input and returns the result back to the console after execution. The REPL session provides a convenient way to quickly test simple JavaScript code.\r\n\r\n28. Tracing : -\r\n\r\nTracing is a convenient way for developers to monitor and analyze application performance at runtime. Node. js offers a few options to generate and diagnose custom trace data in JavaScript applications. The built-in trace mechanism supports centralized tracing for not only V8 and Node. js core, but also userspace code.\r\n\r\nYou can also use the flag --trace-warnings , which will give you the stack trace of where the warning is coming from whenever you encounter a warning. This warning is showing something that might not work in the future: a deprecation warning .\r\n\r\n29. Packages.json : -\r\n\r\nYour package. json holds important information about the project. It contains human-readable metadata about the project (like the project name and description) as well as functional metadata like the package version number and a list of dependencies required by the application.\r\n\r\n30. Difference between read file and create file : -\r\n\r\nreadfile loads the whole file into the memory you pointed out, the fs. createReadStream, on the other hand, reads the entire file in chunks of sizes that you specified. The client will also receive the data faster with fs\r\n\r\n31. Crypto module : -\r\n\r\nThis module can be used for encrypting, decrypting, or hashing any type of data. This encryption and decryption basically help to secure and add a layer of authentication to the data. The main use case of the crypto module is to convert the plain readable text to an encrypted format and decrypt it when required\r\n\r\n32. Passport : -\r\n\r\nThe Passport is a node package, or library which we can install in any nodeJs project. The Passport provides the functionality for authentication in the app. Also, it provides different encryption strategies to encrypt user information, such as a password.\r\n\r\n33. how to get file information in node js ?\r\n\r\nTo get information about a file, we can use the fs. Stats object, which is returned by the fs. stat() , fs.\r\n\r\n34. DNS lookup function : -\r\n\r\nlookup() Method. The dns. lookup() method resolves the host name (e.g., tutorialspoint.com) into the first found A IPv4) or AAAA (IPv6) record. The properties available under the options are optional.\r\n\r\nThe node:dns module enables name resolution. For example, use it to look up IP addresses of host names. Although named for the Domain Name System (DNS), it does not always use the DNS protocol for lookups. dns. lookup() uses the operating system facilities to perform name resolution.\r\n\r\n35. Eventemitter : -\r\n\r\nThe EventEmitter class can be used to create and handle custom events module. The syntax to Import the events module are given below: Syntax: const EventEmitter = require('events'); All EventEmitters emit the event newListener when new listeners are added and removeListener when existing listeners are removed.\r\n\r\n36. Settimeout() vs setimmediate() : -\r\n\r\nsetImmediate() and setTimeout() are similar, but behave in different ways depending on when they are called. setImmediate() is designed to execute a script once the current poll phase completes. setTimeout() schedules a script to be run after a minimum threshold in ms has elapsed.\r\n\r\n37. Module exports purpose : -\r\n\r\nmodule. Exports is the object that is returned to the require() call. By module. exports, we can export functions, objects, and their references from one file and can use them in other files by importing them by require() method.\r\n\r\n38. What is the difference between asynchronous and non-blocking Nodejs?\r\n\r\n    Non-Blocking: It refers to the program that does not block the execution of further operations. Non-Blocking methods are executed asynchronously. Asynchronously means that the program may not necessarily execute line by line\r\n\r\n39. Error first callback : -\r\n\r\nError-First Callback in Node. js is a function which either returns an error object or any successful data returned by the function. The first argument in the function is reserved for the error object. If any error has occurred during the execution of the function, it will be returned by the first argument.\r\n\r\n40. Url module : -\r\n\r\nThe URL module in Node. js is used when working with URLs in our Node. js file. It provides functions to access different parts of our URL. We use this module in web development when we work with URLs to make HTTP requests to external APIs and handle file paths.\r\n\r\n41. Use of NODE\\_ENV : -\r\n\r\nNODE\\_ENV is an environment variable that stands for node environment in the express server. The NODE\\_ENV environment variable specifies the environment in which an application is running (usually, development or production)\r\n\r\n42. **What are the various timing features of Node. js ?**\r\n- callback: This parameter holds the function that to be executed.\r\n- delay: This parameter holds the number of milliseconds to wait before calling the callback function.\r\n- args: This parameter holds the optional parameter.\r\n43. **Below is the list of the tasks which must be done asynchronously using the event loop:**\r\n- I/O operations.\r\n- Heavy computation.\r\n- Anything requiring blocking.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous flow refers to the way Node. js handles and executes ensuring that the main program flow remains unblocked. As a server-side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node. js efficiently manages concurrent tasks and optimizes resource utilization.\r\n\r\n44. Reactor pattern : -\r\n\r\nNote: Node. js is Asynchronous in nature. Reactor Pattern comprises of: Resources: They are shared by multiple applications for I/O operations, generally slower in executions. Synchronous Event De-multiplexer/Event Notifier: This uses Event Loop for blocking on all resources.\r\n\r\n45. Frontend vs backend development : -\r\n\r\nNode. js can also be used with popular frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, to create scalable and high-performance applications. On the backend, Node. js is used to develop server-side applications that handle network requests, data processing, and database operations.\r\n\r\n46. Major security implementation : -\r\n\r\nEstablishing practices like validating user input, implementing authentication, limiting request sizes, and setting up logging and monitoring are good first steps to securing Node. js. For specific concerns about code injection attacks, here are five ways to prevent code injection in Node.\r\n\r\n- Allow Using Secure Passwords Only. ...\r\n- Secure Your Stored Passwords with Encryption. ...\r\n- Limit the Number of Login Attempts per User per Unit of Time. ...\r\n- Keep Your Node. ...\r\n- Do Not Install Questionable Packages. ...\r\n- Always Validate Input and Output Data. ...\r\n- Always Replace Default Cookie Names.\r\n47. ESLint : -\r\n\r\nESLint is the dominant tool for linting Node. JS packages. It is a pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. It uses the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to evaluate patterns in code.\r\n\r\nOne of the main benefits of using ESLint for software security is that it automates the detection of potential vulnerabilities. This can save you time and effort that would be spent manually reviewing your code, and can help you catch issues early on in the development process before they become a bigger problem.\r\n\r\n48. Stubs : -\r\n\r\nStubs are functions or programs that affect the behavior of components or modules. Stubs are dummy objects for testing. Stubs implement a pre-programmed response.\r\n\r\n49. process.nexttick vs setimmediate in node js : -\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that setImmediate adds callbacks to the event queue that are executed during the check phase, whereas process. nextTick executes callbacks immediately after the current phase.\r\n\r\nsetImmediate() is processed in the Check handlers phase, while process. nextTick() is processed at the starting of the event loop and between each phase of the event loop.\r\n\r\n50. How does NodeJS handle child threads?\r\n\r\nNode. js is a single-threaded runtime, which means that it does not have the ability to create child threads or to delegate work to them. However, it is designed to be highly scalable and can perform non-blocking I/O operations, allowing it to handle many concurrent connections without the need for child threads.\r\n\r\nIt does not expose child threads and thread management methods to the developer. Technically, Node. js does spawn child threads for certain tasks such as asynchronous I/O, but these run behind the scenes and do not execute any application JavaScript code, nor block the main event loop.\r\n\r\n51. Punycode : -\r\n\r\nPunycode is a character encoding scheme defined by RFC 3492 that is primarily intended for use in Internationalized Domain Names. Because host names in URLs are limited to ASCII characters only, Domain Names that contain non-ASCII characters must be converted into ASCII using the Punycode scheme.\r\n\r\nPunycode is a special encoding for converting Unicode characters in different languages to ASCII. It is used to correctly transcode a domain name containing non-Latin characters into addresses that comply with DNS standards.\r\n\r\n52. Exit code of node : -\r\n\r\nThe following is the list of exit codes in Node.js along with its descriptions:\r\n\r\n- **Exit Code 0:** Node.js normally ends with a status code of 0 whenever there are no more open async operations and the code doesn’t produce any uncaught exceptions.\r\n- **Exit Code 1, Uncaught Fatal Exception:** If an uncaught exception occurs and it is not resolved by a domain or a “uncaughtException” event handler, Node.js exits with an exit code of 1.\r\n- **Exit Code 2:** The exit code 2 is reserved by Bash for abuse of built-in features.\r\n- **Exit Code 3, Internal JavaScript Parse Error:** When internal code cannot be effectively interpreted, this exit code might be utilised in development. This is highly uncommon and often only occurs while Node.js is being developed.\r\n- **Exit Code 4, Internal JavaScript Evaluation Failure:** It is also applied in situations where the JavaScript code fails to return the function value during development.\r\n- **Exit Code 5, Fatal Error:** When a fatal, unrecoverable error occurred in V8, this exit code is utilised. Usually, stderr will produce a message with the prefix FATAL ERROR.\r\n- **Exit Code 6, Non-function Internal Exception Handler:** When an internal fatal exception handler function is set to a non-function and unable to be invoked, it is helpful.\r\n- **Exit Code 7, Internal Exception Handler Run-Time Failure:** This error code is used when the internal fatal exception handler code itself issued an error when attempting to handle the uncaught exception. This may occur, for instance, if a domain.on(‘error’) handler or a “uncaughtException” returns an error.\r\n- **Exit Code 8:** Exit code 8 in earlier versions of Node.js was sometimes used to denote an uncaught error.\r\n- **Exit Code 9, Invalid Argument:** This is employed when an unspecified option was given or when a value-required option was given without one..\r\n- **Exit Code 10, Internal JavaScript Run-Time Failure:** When the bootstrapping function was invoked, the JavaScript source code internal to Node.js’s bootstrapping procedure threw an error.\r\n- **Exit Code 12, Invalid Debug Argument:** The ports specified were either unavailable or invalid, yet the —debug, —inspect, and/or —debug-brk options were set.\r\n- **Exit Code \u003e128, Signal Exits:** Node.js’s exit code is 128 plus the signal code’s value if it gets a fatal signal like SIGKILL or SIGHUP. This is a common Unix practice since signal exits set the high-order bit before containing the signal code’s value and exit codes are often specified as 7-bit integers.\r\n53. Is crypto available in node JS?\r\n\r\nCrypto is a module in Node. js which deals with an algorithm that performs data encryption and decryption. This is used for security purpose like user authentication where storing the password in Database in the encrypted form. Crypto module provides set of classes like hash, HMAC, cipher, decipher, sign, and verify.\r\n\r\n54. how install update and delete a dependency in node js ?\r\n- We can update the project dependencies using the update command: npm update.\r\n- We can update any particular project dependency using the following command: npm update \u003cpackagename\u003e\r\n- We can uninstall a project dependency using the following command: npm uninstall \u003cpackage\\_name\u003e\r\n55. Create simple server : -\r\n- Step 1: Import HTTP module. ...\r\n- Step 2: Create Variables For Host And Port. ...\r\n- Step 3: Create A Server Process. ...\r\n- Step 4: Implement the requestListener function. ...\r\n- Step 5: Start And Test The HTTP Server.\r\n\r\n●\r\n\r\nvar http = require('http'); http.createServer(function (req, res) {\r\n\r\nres.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'}); res.write('Hello World!');\r\n\r\nres.end();\r\n\r\n}).listen(8080);\r\n\r\n56. Implement async : -\r\n\r\nThe asynchronous function can be written in Node. js using 'async' preceding the function name. The asynchronous function returns an implicit Promise as a result. The async function helps to write promise-based code asynchronously via the event loop\r\n\r\n57. Types of http request : -\r\n\r\nHTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) specifies a collection of request methods to specify what action is to be performed on a particular resource. The most commonly used HTTP request methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.\r\n\r\n58. Npm : -\r\n\r\nWhat is NPM? NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules if you like. www.npmjs.com hosts thousands of free packages to download and use. The NPM program is installed on your computer when you install Node.js. NPM is already ready to run on your computer!\r\n\r\n59. Piping : -\r\n\r\nPiping in NodeJS is the process by which byte data from one stream is sent to another stream. What are streams? Streams in NodeJS are a sequence of bytes. When a program processes some data it needs to read all the data into memory and then process it and write out the data back into some location.\r\n\r\n60. Flag used in read/write operation : -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n||||\r\n| :- | :- | :- |\r\n||r|Open file for reading. An exception occurs if the file does not exist.|\r\n|r+|Open file for reading and writing. An exception occurs if the file does not exist.||\r\n|rs|Open file for reading in synchronous mode.||\r\n|rs+|Open file for reading and writing, telling the OS to open it synchronously. See notes for 'rs' about using this with caution.||\r\n|w|Open file for writing. The file is created (if it does not exist) or truncated (if it exists).||\r\n|wx|Like 'w' but fails if path exists.||\r\n|w+|Open file for reading and writing. The file is created (if it does not exist) or truncated (if it exists).||\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n|wx+|Like 'w+' but fails if path exists.|\r\n| - | - |\r\n|a|Open file for appending. The file is created if it does not exist.|\r\n|ax|Like 'a' but fails if path exists.|\r\n|a+|Open file for reading and appending. The file is created if it does not exist.|\r\n|ax+|Like 'a+' but fails if path exists.|\r\n\r\n61. Process model : -\r\n\r\nContrary to the traditional web server model, NodeJS uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. The NodeJS process model can be explained with three architectural features of NodeJS. Single-threaded event loop. Non-Blocking I/O Model. Event-driven and Asynchronous by default\r\n\r\n62. Chaining : -\r\n\r\nIn Node.js, chaining refers to the practice of calling multiple functions on the same object in a single statement.\r\n\r\n63. CLI in node js : -\r\n\r\nCommand-line interfaces (CLIs) built-in Node. js authorize automating repetitive tasks while leveraging the Node. js ecosystem. Package managers like npm and yarn are distributed and ingested across multiple platforms.\r\n\r\njs. We use command-line utilities every day, whether it be git, grep, awk, npm, or any other terminal app. CLIs are super useful and usually the fastest way to get something done.\r\n\r\n64. require() method : -\r\n\r\nThe require() function is a built-in CommonJS module function supported in Node.js that lets you include modules within your project. This is because, by default, Node.js treats JavaScript code as CommonJS modules.\r\n\r\n65. Why node js use v8 : -\r\n\r\nV8 is a high-performance JavaScript engine developed by Google and used in Google Chrome, the open-source browser from Google. It was designed to improve the performance of web applications by compiling JavaScript into native machine code rather than interpreting it, which makes it faster\r\n\r\n66. Template engine : -\r\n\r\nTemplate engine helps to create an HTML template with minimal code. Also, it can inject data into an HTML template on the client side and produce the final HTML. EJS is a simple templating language that is used to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It also helps to embed JavaScript into HTML pages.\r\n\r\n67. Express generator : -\r\n\r\nExpress-generator is an all-in-one tool that allows you to quickly create a node-js application using the express library. Thanks to this generator, it will be possible to specify the template (view), the CSS preprocessor, etc.\r\n\r\n68. Template literals : -\r\n\r\nTemplate literals are literals delimited with backtick ( ` ) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates\r\n\r\n69. CSRF attack : -\r\n\r\nCross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF or XSRF for short) works by an attacker gaining access to a victim's browser — typically through a malicious link.\r\n\r\njs prevents the Cross-Site Request Forgery(CSRF) attack on an application. By using this module, when a browser renders up a page from the server, it sends a randomly generated string as a CSRF token. Therefore, when the POST request is performed, it will send the random CSRF token as a cookie.\r\n\r\n70. Microservice : -\r\n\r\nNode. js Microservices are self-contained and independent of each other. This means that every service is developed, deployed, and scaled as a separate and standalone unit. They do not have any dependency on other services even though these services combine to form the application. This is called as loose-coupling.\r\n\r\nNode. js is ideal for building microservices due to its non-blocking I/O model, event-driven architecture, and lightweight design. As a result, it enables developers to create high-performance, real-time applications that can scale easily and remain resilient in the face of failure.\r\n\r\n71. Docker hub : -\r\n\r\nDocker will create containerized applications that run on any type of environment that have all the dependencies within it. So setting up the development environment is just one command away. Docker has many use cases – this scenario is just one of them\r\n\r\nDocker Hub is a collaboration tool and a marketplace for community developers, open source contributors, and independent software vendors (ISVs) to distribute their code publicly. Docker Hub provides a consistent, secure, and trusted experience, making it easy for developers to access software they need.\r\n\r\n**EXPRESS-JS**\r\n\r\n1. What is express ?\r\n\r\nIt is used for designing and building web applications quickly and easily. Web applications are web apps that you can run on a web browser. Since Express. js only requires javascript, it becomes easier for programmers and developers to build web applications and API without any effort.\r\n\r\n2. Features : -\r\n\r\nExpress. js can be used for various purposes, including building single-page applications, mobile applications, RESTful APIs, server-side rendering, real-time applications, and microservices. Express. js provides various key features, including routing, middleware, templates, error handling, security, and ease of use.\r\n\r\n3. Advantage and disadvantage : -\r\n\r\n**Advantages of ExpressJS:**\r\n\r\n- Minimal and Lightweight. Express. ...\r\n- Easy to Learn and Use. Express. ...\r\n- Middleware Support. One of the key features of Express. ...\r\n- Routing. Express. ...\r\n- Template Engines. Express. ...\r\n- Database Support. Express. ...\r\n- Scalability. Express. ...\r\n- Lack of Structure and Convention. One of the primary limitations of using Express.\r\n\r\n**disadvantages of express. js?**\r\n\r\n- Event-driven nature (callbacks)\r\n- Code organization.\r\n- Its not big on security.\r\n- Its error messages are usually unhelpful.\r\n4. how express handle routing ?\r\n\r\nYou define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, see app.METHOD.\r\n\r\n5. Middleware : -\r\n\r\nMiddleware functions are functions that have access to the request object ( req ), the response object ( res ), and the next function in the application's request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.\r\n\r\n**An Express application can use the following types of middleware:**\r\n\r\n- Application-level middleware.\r\n- Router-level middleware.\r\n- Error-handling middleware.\r\n- Built-in middleware.\r\n- Third-party middleware.\r\n\r\n●\r\n\r\nYou can enable your custom middleware in your Express server by applying the built-in Express. js middleware, . use() . const express = require('express'); const setCurrentUser = require('./middleware/setCurrentUser.\r\n\r\nMiddleware Chaining: Middleware can be chained from one to another, Hence creating a chain of functions that are executed in order. The last function sends the response back to the browser. So, before sending the response back to the browser the different middleware process the request.\r\n\r\n6. how can you handle form data in express js ?\r\n\r\nGetting form data with the post method in Express. js. First, we need to install the express and body-parser packages. body-parser is used to process the data sent through an HTTP request.\r\n\r\nconst express = require('express'); const app = express();\r\n\r\napp.post('/submit-form', (req, res) =\u003e {\r\n\r\nconst name = req.body.name;\r\n\r\nconst email = req.body.email;\r\n\r\n//Do some processing and validation on the data //Store the data in a database or send it as an email\r\n\r\nres.send('Form submitted successfully!');\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.listen(3000, () =\u003e console.log('Server running on port 3000')); const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\r\n\r\n7. How can you handle static file ?\r\n\r\nTo serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static built-in middleware function in Express. The root argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets. For more information on the options argument, see express.static.\r\n\r\nServing static files in Expressjs: ExpressJS provides a built-in middleware function called express. static() that allows you to serve static files in your application. This middleware takes a directory path as an argument and serves any files in that directory at their respective URL paths.\r\n\r\nUsing express. static() method, you can server static resources directly by specifying the folder name where you have stored your static resources. The following example serves static resources from the public folder under the root folder of your application.\r\n\r\n8. purpose of next() in express js : -\r\n\r\nThe next() function is a function in the Express router that, when invoked, executes the next middleware in the middleware stack. If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.\r\n\r\nThe next() function returns the next item in an iterator. You can add a default return value, to return if the iterable has reached to its end.\r\n\r\n9. how can you handle route parameter in express js ?\r\n\r\nRoute parameters are accessible in the route handling function on the params property of the Request object. Recall from the previous tutorials that both a Request and Response object are passed as input of the route handling function by the Express.\r\n\r\n10. how can you implement authentication ?\r\n\r\nAuthentication is a process in which the credentials provided are compared to those on file in a database of authorized users' information on a local operating system or within an authentication server. If the credentials match, the process is completed and the user is granted authorization for access.\r\n\r\n**Implementing User Authentication in Express Apps**\r\n\r\n- Step 1: Setting Up Development Environment. First, create a project folder and cd into it by running: mkdir user-authentication. ...\r\n- Step 2: Connecting Your Application to a Database. ...\r\n- Step 3: Creating User Model. ...\r\n- Step 4: Implementing Sign-in and Sign-up Routes.\r\n11. How can you handle error ?\r\n\r\nThe simplest way of handling errors in Express applications is by putting the error handling logic in the individual route handler functions. We can either check for specific error conditions or use a try-catch block for intercepting the error condition before invoking the logic for handling the error.\r\n\r\n12. What is route handler in Express JS?\r\n\r\nAs a generic term, a route handler is code that is looking for a request to a specific incoming URL such as /login and often a specific HTTP verb such as POST and has specific code for handling that precise URL and verb. Some examples: Serve a specific web page.\r\n\r\n13. how can you access request query parameters ?\r\n\r\nYour query parameters can be retrieved from the query object on the request object sent to your route. It is in the form of an object in which you can directly access the query parameters you care about. In this case Express handles all of the URL parsing for you and exposes the retrieved parameters as this object.\r\n\r\nWe can access these route parameters on our req. params object using the syntax shown below. app. get(/:id, (req, res) =\u003e { const id = req.params.id; });\r\n\r\n14. How can you send json response ?\r\n\r\njson() function sends a JSON response. This method sends a response (with the correct content-type) that is the parameter converted to a JSON string using the JSON. stringify() method. Parameters: The body parameter is the body that is to be sent in the response.\r\n\r\nTo send data as a response to a client we typically use res. send() method, and to send static files we use the res. sendFile() method. In the same way, to send JSON data, the Express module has a method res\r\n\r\n15. How can you handle file upload ?\r\n\r\nTo handle file uploads in Express. js, you can use middleware such as Multer, a Node. js middleware used for handling multipart/form-data, which is mainly used for file uploads.\r\n\r\n16. Difference between app.get() and app.use() : -\r\n\r\napp. use → It is generally used for introducing middlewares in your application and can handle all type of HTTP requests. app. get → It is only for handling GET HTTP requests.\r\n\r\napp. get is called when the HTTP method is set to GET, whereas app. use is called regardless of the HTTP method, and therefore defines a layer which is on top of all the other RESTful types which the express packages gives you access to.\r\n\r\n17. How can you set response header ?\r\n\r\nSelect the web site where you want to add the custom HTTP response header. In the web site pane, double-click HTTP Response Headers in the IIS section. In the actions pane, select Add. In the Name box, type the custom HTTP header name\r\n\r\nWe can use the set method to set response headers before sending a response. app. listen(3000); Then when we make a request to / , we get that the Content-Length header is set to 100 and the Content-Type is set to text/plain .\r\n\r\n18. Purpose of app.locals object : -\r\n\r\nThe app. locals object defines the properties that are local variables inside an application. Once the value of app. locals property is set, it persists throughout the life of the application\r\n\r\n19. how can you implement session management ?\r\n\r\nYou can install and configure these middleware options using npm . Once installed, we can require it in our Node. js application and configure it as follows: const express = require('express'); const session = require('express-session'); const app = express(); app.\r\n\r\n20. how can you handle cors ?\r\n\r\nCross-origin resource sharing (CORS) allows AJAX requests to skip the Same-origin policy and access resources from remote hosts.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get CORS working in Express is by using the cors npm module. That's it. CORS is now enabled. The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header determines which origins are allowed to access server resources over CORS (the \\* wildcard allows access from any origin).\r\n\r\nYou need to configure the server to only allow one origin to serve, and block all the others. Using the same cors Node library, here's how you would do it: const cors = require('cors') const corsOptions = { origin: 'https://yourdomain.com', } app. get('/products/:id', cors(corsOptions), (req, res, next) =\u003e { //... })\r\n\r\n21. Route prefix : -\r\n\r\nA prefix is found within the routing table and composes part of the route. A route is a particular entry in the routing table. A route is composed of a prefix, and either a next hop IP, an exit interface, or both.\r\n\r\n22. How can you implement rate limiting ?\r\n\r\n**To set up a rate limiter, we need to define two parameters:**\r\n\r\n- The consumer ID: It is the unique identifier associated with a client consuming our API. The IP address is the most used, and we will use it in our case.\r\n- Request per window: The maximum number of requests to execute in a specific timeframe.\r\n\r\nExpress Rate Limit: Rate limiting prevents the same IP address from making too many requests that will help us prevent attacks like brute force. Required Dependency: npm install express-rate-limit. Project Setup: Run the following sets of commands to create a folder and initialize the project.\r\n\r\n**This approach to rate limiting is easy to build in a NodeJS-Express app, with just a few steps.**\r\n\r\n- Step 1: Setting Up a Development Environment. First, you'll need to create and initialize an Express application. ...\r\n- Step 2: Creating an Express Application. ...\r\n- Step 3: Creating Route Handlers. ...\r\n- Step 4: Implementing Rate Limiting.\r\n23. Purpose of view engine : -\r\n\r\nView engines allow us to render web pages using template files. These templates are filled with actual data and served to the client. There are multiple view engines, the most popular of which is Embedded Javascript (EJS).\r\n\r\nThe Express application generator uses Jade as its default, but it also supports several others. See Template Engines (Express wiki) for a list of template engines you can use with Express. See also Comparing JavaScript Templating Engines: Jade, Mustache, Dust and More. Note: Jade has been renamed to Pug.\r\n\r\n24. how can you handle redirects ?\r\n\r\nThe res. redirect() method in ExpressJS can be used to execute a redirect. The client is given navigation instructions by this function, which accepts a URL as a parameter.\r\n\r\nExpressJS provides the facility to redirect to any URL with any status code. By default, the status code is set to 302. We can change the status code in the res. redirect() function by passing the new status code as the first parameter.\r\n\r\n25. How can you access request headers ?\r\n\r\nIn express, we can use request. headers['header-name'], For example if you have set up a Bearer token in authorization header and want to retrieve the token, then you should write req. headers['authorization'], and you will get the string containing 'Bearer tokenString'.\r\n\r\n26. how can you enable compression ?\r\n\r\nyou can use the module in your application after you initialize your server, like with Express. js: const compression = require('compression'); const express = require('express'); const app = express(); // compress all responses app. use(compression()); app\r\n\r\nCompression encodes information into a smaller size than the original, decreasing the bandwidth usage of an application and providing faster download speeds for clients.\r\n\r\n27. Purpose of app.route method : -\r\n\r\nThe app. route() function returns an instance of a single route, which you can then use to handle HTTP verbs with optional middleware. Use app. route() to avoid duplicate route names (and thus typo errors)\r\n\r\n28. how can you implement input validation ?\r\n\r\n**How to Validate and Sanitize an ExpressJS Form**\r\n\r\n- Install the express-validator library for use with an ExpressJS server.\r\n- Validate user input from a login form.\r\n- Sanitize user input from a login form.\r\n- Return validation errors to the user to improve the UX.\r\n\r\nSteps to use express-validator to implement the logic:\r\n\r\nInstall express-validator middleware. Create a validator. js file to code all the validation logic. Validate input by validateInputField: check(input field name) and chain on the validation equals() with '\r\n\r\n29. How do you handle cookies : -\r\n\r\n**Express.js Cookies Example**\r\n\r\n- var express = require('express');\r\n- var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');\r\n- var app = express();\r\n- app.use(cookieParser());\r\n- app.get('/cookieset',function(req, res){\r\n- res.cookie('cookie\\_name', 'cookie\\_value');\r\n- res.cookie('company', 'javatpoint');\r\n- res.cookie('name', 'sonoo');\r\n\r\nvar cookieSession = require('cookie-session') var express = require('express') var app = express() app. use(cookieSession({ name: 'session', keys: ['key1', 'key2'] })) // Update a value in the cookie so that the set-cookie will be sent. // Only changes every minute so that it's not sent with every request.\r\n\r\n30. How do you implement Caching : -\r\n\r\n**Create an Express Node JS application**\r\n\r\n- npx express expressNodeCaching --hbs. BASIC.\r\n- npm i. Bash.\r\n- npm i node-cache npm i isomorphic-fetch. Bash.\r\n- app.use('/getCached', require('./routes/getCached')); Bash.\r\n- new nodecache({ stdTTL : 3599}); BASIC.\r\n- npm start. BASIC.\r\n31. Concept of view rendering : -\r\n\r\nThe function used to render an HTML view and to send the rendered HTML data to the client is known as the res. render() function. In Express, this function has two parameters in it, that are, Locals: It is an object whose properties would define the view. Callback: A callback function as an optional parameter.\r\n\r\nExpress has two methods to render views: app. render() , which is used to render the view and then pass the HTML to a callback function, and the more common res. render() , which renders the view locally and sends the HTML as a response.\r\n\r\n32. How can you implement logging ?\r\n\r\n**Process a User Login Form with ExpressJS**\r\n\r\n- Create an example HTML login form.\r\n- Set up GET routes using ExpressJS.\r\n- Set up a POST route to get form data into Node.\r\n- Learn about route paths and handlers.\r\n\r\nmorgan middleware\r\n\r\nThe morgan middleware can be used as many times as needed, enabling combinations like: Log entry on request and one on response. Log all requests to file, but errors to console.\r\n\r\n33. How can you handle async await : -\r\n\r\nAsync/Await is used to work with promises in asynchronous functions. It is basically syntactic sugar for promises. It is just a wrapper to restyle code and make promises easier to read and use. It makes asynchronous code look more like synchronous/procedural code, which is easier to understand. To use async/await, you need to use the async keyword when you define a request handler. (Note: These request handlers are also called “controllers”. I prefer calling them request handlers because “request handlers” is more explicit). Once you have the async keyword, you can await something immediately in your code\r\n\r\n34. Purpose of express.router() : -\r\n\r\nThe express. Router() function is used to create a new router object. This function is used when you want to create a new router object in your program to handle requests. Multiple requests can be easily differentiated with the help of the Router() function in Express.\r\n\r\n35. Websocket communication : -\r\n\r\nWebSocket is a full-duplex, bidirectional protocol as opposed to HTTP. Since it is a stateful protocol, it will maintain a connection between the client and server until one of them decides to break it. Because the connection is constant, real-time communication between the client and the server is possible\r\n\r\nTo open a websocket connection, we need to create new WebSocket using the special protocol ws in the url: let socket = new WebSocket ( \"ws://javascript.info\" ) ; There's also encrypted wss:// protocol. It's like HTTPS for websockets.\r\n\r\nIn theory, a server can handle up to 65,536 sockets per single IP address.\r\n\r\n36. Input sanitizer : -\r\n\r\nInput Sanitization with Validator.\r\n\r\nValidator. js is a library that provides various string validation and sanitization functions. We can leverage it to sanitize user input and remove potentially harmful characters. // Example: Sanitizing user input with Validator.js const validator = require('validator'); app.\r\n\r\n**How to Validate and Sanitize an ExpressJS Form**\r\n\r\n- Install the express-validator library for use with an ExpressJS server.\r\n- Validate user input from a login form.\r\n- Sanitize user input from a login form.\r\n- Return validation errors to the user to improve the UX.\r\n37. RBAC : -\r\n\r\nRole-based access control (RBAC) is a security approach that restricts network access and assigns permissions to users based on their role within an organization\r\n\r\n**How to Implement RBAC in 8 Steps**\r\n\r\n- Audit your current status. The first thing you need to do is audit your current status. ...\r\n- Define roles. ...\r\n- Query-level implementation. ...\r\n- Interface-level implementation. ...\r\n- Component-level implementation. ...\r\n- Testing roles and implementation. ...\r\n- Role assignment. ...\r\n- Monitoring and auditing.\r\n38. Session timeout : -\r\n\r\nThe session timeout determines the time a user can remain idle before the session is terminated and the user must log in again. The session time out includes administrators logged in through the portal service.\r\n\r\nTo expire the session after 1 min of inactivity in the express-session of Express. js we use expires: 60000 in the middleware function.\r\n\r\nlisten() to make sure our server is running. Here we set different options in session. In the cookie. maxAge is used to determine the specific time after which the session expires due to inactivity, and the secret is used to store the secret key for the session.\r\n\r\n39. SSR : -\r\n\r\nServer-side rendering (SSR) is a popular technique for rendering a normally client-side-only single-page app (SPA) on the server and then sending a fully rendered page to the client. The client's JavaScript bundle can then take over and the SPA can operate as normal.\r\n\r\nWith server-side rendering, you need a server side application which handles the initial rendering of your React application. The server application will import your React applications root component and render it into a HTML document which is then returned to the client.\r\n\r\n40. Throttling : -\r\n\r\nThrottling is the process of limiting the number of requests you (or your authorized developer) can submit to a given operation in a given amount of time.\r\n\r\nThrottling is often used to manage API traffic and prevent overloading—by ensuring that a server can handle requests from multiple clients without slowing down or crashing.\r\n\r\n41. Api versioning : -\r\n\r\nAPI versioning is a crucial aspect of developing and maintaining RESTful APIs, as it allows developers to introduce new features, fix bugs, and make changes without breaking the existing functionality for clients.\r\n\r\n**There are 5 main ways to version REST APIs:**\r\n\r\n- Versioning using URI Path. URI Path versioning strategy puts the version number in the path of the URI. ...\r\n- Versioning using Query Parameters. ...\r\n- Versioning using Custom Request Headers. ...\r\n- Versioning via Media type. ...\r\n- Versioning using multiple strategies.\r\n42. Pagination : -\r\n\r\nPagination is where a user can use links such as “next”, “previous”, and page numbers to navigate between pages that display one page of results at a time. Pagination in Node. js involves splitting a large dataset into smaller chunks, known as pages, and displaying them one page at a time.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the express and mongoose packages, we can build a primary express server and connect to our MongoDB database, gradually making the pagination. const express = require(\"express\"); const mongoose = require(\"mongoose\"); const app = express(); mongoose . connect(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/pgtest\")\r\n\r\n43. Can WebSocket and HTTP run on same port?\r\n\r\nNginx will let you receive both your HTTP and websocket traffic on a single domain and port, and then forward each one on to the correct app. It can do this because websockets starts out as a regular HTTP GET request\r\n\r\n44. SSE : -\r\n\r\nServer-Sent Events (SSE) is a Web standard that allows a server application to send data to the client. Concretely, a browser can subscribe to a stream of events generated by a server, receiving updates whenever a new event occurs. This feature makes it possible to build a more reactive application\r\n\r\nThe server-sent events streaming can be started by the client's GET request to Server. Accept: text/event-stream indicates the client waiting for event stream from the server, Cache-Control: no-cache indicates that disabling the caching and Connection: keep-alive indicates the persistent connection.\r\n\r\n45. how do you handle file download ?\r\n\r\ndownload() function which takes two parameters the path of the file and a function to handle if any error occurs. Downloading multiple files as a zipped folder for this we would use the “express-zip” npm package which creates a zipped folder using the zip() function which takes an array of objects as a parameter.\r\n\r\n46. Convert json int string : -\r\n\r\nThe JSON.stringify() static method converts a JavaScript value to a JSON string, optionally replacing values if a replacer function is specified or optionally including only the specified properties if a replacer array is specified\r\n\r\n47. Create http server using express : -\r\n\r\nconst express = require('express')\r\n\r\nconst app = express()\r\n\r\nconst port = 3000\r\n\r\napp.get('/', (req, res) =\u003e {\r\n\r\nres.send('Hello World!')\r\n\r\n})\r\n\r\napp.listen(port, () =\u003e {\r\n\r\nconsole.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`) })\r\n\r\n48. Templates : -\r\n\r\nTemplate engine is a part of Express that enables us to use static files in our applications. Template engine converts variables to values and changes the template to HTML files to send to the client. The default template engine of Express is Jade, but EJS is the most commonly used engine\r\n\r\n**—MONGO-DB—**\r\n\r\n1. WHAT IS MONGODB ?\r\n\r\nMongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas. As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents.\r\n\r\n2. Features : -\r\n- Support ad hoc queries. ...\r\n- Indexing. ...\r\n- Replication. ...\r\n- Duplication of data. ...\r\n- Load balancing. ...\r\n- Supports map reduce and aggregation tools.\r\n- Uses JavaScript instead of Procedures.\r\n- It is a schema-less database written in C++.\r\n3. Advantage and disadvantage : -\r\n- Advantages of MongoDB. Performance Levels. High Speed and Higher Availability. Simplicity. Easy Environment and a Quick Set-up. Flexibility. Sharding. Scalability. ...\r\n- Disadvantages of MongoDB. Transactions. Joins. Indexing. Limited Data Size and Nesting. Duplicates. High Memory Usage.\r\n4. What is a document ?\r\n\r\nA record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects. The values of fields may include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.\r\n\r\n5. Collection : -\r\n\r\nA collection is a grouping of MongoDB documents. Documents within a collection can have different fields. A collection is the equivalent of a table in a relational database system. A collection exists within a single database.\r\n\r\n6. Replica set : -\r\n\r\nA replica set in MongoDB is a group of mongod processes that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section introduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture of replica sets.\r\n\r\n7. Primary replica set : -\r\n\r\nThe primary is the only member in the replica set that receives write operations. MongoDB applies write operations on the primary and then records the operations on the primary's oplog. Secondary members replicate this log and apply the operations to their data sets.\r\n\r\nYou can force a replica set member to become primary by giving it a higher members[n]. priority value than any other member in the set. Optionally, you also can force a member never to become primary by setting its members[n]. priority value to 0 , which means the member can never seek election as primary.\r\n\r\n8. Secondary replica set : -\r\n\r\nA secondary maintains a copy of the primary's data set. To replicate data, a secondary applies operations from the primary's oplog to its own data set in an asynchronous process. [1] A replica set can have one or more secondaries.\r\n\r\n9. Replica set oplog : -\r\n\r\nThe oplog (operations log) is a special capped collection that keeps a rolling record of all operations that modify the data stored in your databases. Unlike other capped collections, the oplog can grow past its configured size limit to avoid deleting the majority commit point .\r\n\r\n10. Sharding : -\r\n\r\nSharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations. Database systems with large data sets or high throughput applications can challenge the capacity of a single server.\r\n\r\n11. What is the difference between sharding and partitioning in MongoDB?\r\n\r\n    Sharding and partitioning are both about breaking up a large data set into smaller subsets. The difference is that sharding implies the data is spread across multiple computers while partitioning does not. Partitioning is about grouping subsets of data within a single database instance.\r\n\r\n12. Indexing : -\r\n\r\nIndexes are data structures that support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. They contain copies of parts of the data in documents to make queries more efficient. Without indexes, MongoDB must scan every document in a collection to find the documents that match each query.\r\n\r\n13. Types of indexing : -\r\n1. **Single field Index:** A single field index means index on a single field of a document. This index is helpful for fetching data in ascending as well as descending order.\r\n1. **Compound Index:** This is a user-defined index supported in MongoDB where multiple fields can be indexed. To create a compound index, the query is db.collection.createIndex( { \u003cfieldname1: 1/-1, fieldname2: 1/-1, … }). Here, the compound index query is similar to a normal index query but with multiple fields.\r\n1. **MultiKey Indexing:** Now this is one indexing that works on values stored in an array. Here, for each element in an array, MongoDB creates an index.\r\n1. **Text Indexing:** For the purpose of searching the string content or an array of string, ina collection, indexing over the test is supported in MongoDB.\r\n1. **Hashed Index:** Using the hashes of the indexed fields’ values, Hashed Indexing in MongoDB is achieved. MongoDB also supports sharding based on the hash. The aim is to reduce the size of the index. Range queries are not supported here.\r\n14. Mapreduce : -\r\n\r\nMap-reduce is a data processing paradigm for condensing large volumes of data into useful aggregated results. To perform map-reduce operations, MongoDB provides the mapReduce database command.\r\n\r\nMapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating big data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.\r\n\r\n15. Aggregation and aggregation pipeline : -\r\n\r\nAggregation is a way of processing a large number of documents in a collection by means of passing them through different stages. The stages make up what is known as a pipeline. The stages in a pipeline can filter, sort, group, reshape and modify documents that pass through the pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe aggregation pipeline refers to a specific flow of operations that processes, transforms, and returns results. In a pipeline, successive operations are informed by the previous result. Let's take a typical pipeline: Input -\u003e $match -\u003e $group -\u003e $sort -\u003e output.\r\n\r\nAggregation operations allow you to group, sort, perform calculations, analyze data, and much more. Aggregation pipelines can have one or more \"stages\". The order of these stages are important. Each stage acts upon the results of the previous stage.\r\n\r\n16. Update vs save : -\r\n\r\nMongoDB's update() and save() methods are used to update document into a collection. The update() method updates the values in the existing document while the save() method replaces the existing document with the document passed in save() method.\r\n\r\n17. gridFs : -\r\n\r\nGridFS is the MongoDB specification for storing and retrieving large files such as images, audio files, video files, etc. It is kind of a file system to store files but its data is stored within MongoDB collections. GridFS has the capability to store files even greater than its document size limit of 16MB.\r\n\r\n18. Primary vs secondary key : -\r\n\r\nA primary key is the field in a database that is the primary key used to uniquely identify a record in a database. A secondary key is an additional key, or alternate key, which can be use in addition to the primary key to locate specific data.\r\n\r\n19. how does mongodb ensure data consistency ?\r\n\r\nIf the primary member fails, MongoDB preserves consistency by suspending writes until a new primary is elected. Any writes to the failed primary that have not been replicated are rolled back when it returns to the cluster as a secondary.\r\n\r\nMongoDB allows multiple clients to read and write the same data. To ensure consistency, MongoDB uses locking and concurrency control to prevent clients from modifying the same data simultaneously. Writes to a single document occur either in full or not at all, and clients always see consistent data.\r\n\r\n20. how does mongodb ensure high availiability of data ?\r\n\r\nReplication is performed in MongoDB to maintain data redundancy and high availability. It is performed by creating multiple copies of your data across multiple servers. Replication is achieved by the replica sets that contain primary and secondary nodes.\r\n\r\n21. how does mongodb handle schema changes ?\r\n\r\nYou can use MongoDB's flexible schema model, which supports differently shaped documents in the same collection, to gradually update your collection's schema. As you update your schema model, the Schema Versioning pattern allows you to track these updates with version numbers.\r\n\r\n22. How transactions are handled in MongoDB?\r\n\r\nTransactions use the transaction-level write concern to commit the write operations. Write operations inside transactions must be issued without explicit write concern specification and use the default write concern. At commit time, the writes are then commited using the transaction-level write concern.\r\n\r\nThe locks in MongoDB are acquired at the transaction level. However only write operations will lock the associated document. Read operations will not lock them. Hence the locks will be released only when the transaction is completed.\r\n\r\n23. Role of mongodb process : -\r\n\r\nMongoDB grants access to data and commands through role-based authorization and provides built-in roles that provide the different levels of access commonly needed in a database system. You can additionally create user-defined roles. A role grants privileges to perform sets of actions on defined resources.\r\n\r\nWhat is the role of the Mongod process in MongoDB?\r\n\r\nmongod is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB system. It handles data requests, manages data format, and performs background management operations. This document provides a complete overview of all command line options for mongod . These options are primarily useful for testing purposes.\r\n\r\n24. Role of mongodb shell : -\r\n\r\nThe mongo shell is an interactive JavaScript interface to MongoDB. You can use the mongo shell to query and update data as well as perform administrative operations.\r\n\r\n25. Role of mongodb handle security : -\r\n\r\nMongoDB offers built-in security controls for all your data – with databases managed in a customer environment or MongoDB Atlas, a fully-managed cloud service. MongoDB enables enterprise-grade security features and simplifies deploying and managing your databases.\r\n\r\n**MongoDB Security Best Practices**\r\n\r\n- Create Separate Security Credentials. To enable authentication, create login credentials for each user or process that accesses MongoDB. ...\r\n- Use Role-Based Access Control. ...\r\n- Encrypt Your Data. ...\r\n- Use the Official MongoDB Packages. ...\r\n- Auditing and Logs. ...\r\n- Apply MongoDB Security Fixes.\r\n26. Join vs lookup : -\r\n\r\nMongoDB Joins are performed by Lookup. It performs a Left Outer Join to two or more Collections. But Lookup is only permitted in Aggregate operations. This is like a pipeline that performs query, filter and group operations.\r\n\r\nGeneraly, sorted joiner is more effective on flat files than lookup, because sorted joiner uses merge join and cashes less rows. Lookup cashes always whole file. If the file is not sorted, it can be comparable.\r\n\r\n27. Backup and recovery : -\r\n\r\nThe MongoDB Backup and Restore Tool allows you to encapsulate the state of a cluster and return to that state at any time. This helps protect you from data loss, as you can restore a database to a MongoDB instance using a created copy of that instance.\r\n\r\n- [Step 1: Create Direct Backups Using Mongodump](https://hevodata.com/learn/mongodump/#Step1)\r\n- [Step 2: Backup a Remote MongoDB Instance](https://hevodata.com/learn/mongodump/#Step2)\r\n- [Step 3: Backup a Secure MongoDB Instance](https://hevodata.com/learn/mongodump/#Step3)\r\n- [Step 4: Select Databases \u0026 Collections](https://hevodata.com/learn/mongodump/#Step4)\r\n- [Step 5: Change the Backup Directory](https://hevodata.com/learn/mongodump/#Step5)\r\n- [Step 6: Create an Archive File](https://hevodata.com/learn/mongodump/#Step6)\r\n- [Step 7: Compress the MongoDB Backup](https://hevodata.com/learn/mongodump/#Step7)\r\n- [Step 8: Restore Database](https://hevodata.com/learn/mongodump/#Step8)\r\n\r\n●\r\n\r\n28. Some alternative of mongodb : -\r\n\r\nSome of the best MongoDB alternatives include Redis, Apache Cassandra, RethinkDB, DynamoDB, OrientDB, CouchDB, and ArangoDB.\r\n\r\n29. How does mongodb store data ?\r\n\r\nMongoDB stores data objects in collections and documents instead of the tables and rows used in traditional relational databases. Collections comprise sets of documents, which are equivalent to tables in a relational database. Documents consist of key-value pairs, which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB.\r\n\r\n30. how mongodb different from sql and better than mysql:\r\n\r\nMongoDB is a more dynamic and complicated choice that is appropriate for hierarchical data because of its fundamental properties, as opposed to a SQL Database, which is still more predetermined and appropriate for other types of data storage. Hence this is the reason MongoDB outshines the SQL database.\r\n\r\nCompared to MySQL, MongoDB is easier to work with. Since there is no need to define schemas beforehand, it gives a chance to users with minimal technical knowledge to immediately start storing data in it. You can use the database with various programming languages, including C, C# and .\r\n\r\n31. Different data models : -\r\n\r\nMongoDB provides two types of data models: — Embedded data model and Normalized data model.\r\n\r\n32. Horizontal and vertical scaling : -\r\n\r\nHorizontal scaling involves adding additional servers and partitioning the system dataset and load over those servers. Vertical scaling involves expanding the resources used by a single server/replica set.\r\n\r\n33. Replication and sharding : -\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, MongoDB replication is the process of creating a copy of the same data set in more than one MongoDB server. This can be achieved by using a Replica Set. A replica set is a group of MongoDB instances that maintain the same data set and pertain to any mongod process.\r\n\r\nReplication can be simply understood as the duplication of the data-set whereas sharding is partitioning the data-set into discrete parts. By sharding, you divided your collection into different parts. Replicating your database means you make imagers of your data-set.1\r\n\r\n34. What is the \\_id field type in MongoDB?\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, by default the \\_id field is an ObjectID, one of MongoDB's BSON types. The ObjectID is the primary key for the stored document and is automatically generated when creating a new document in a collection\r\n\r\n35. what are some utilities for backup and restoring ?\r\n\r\nMongoDB supplies two utilities to manage logical backups: Mongodump and Mongorestore. The Mongodump command dumps a backup of the database into the “. bson” format, and this can be restored by providing the logical statements found in the dump file to the databases.\r\n\r\n36. Role of profiler : -\r\n\r\nThe database profiler collects detailed information about Database Commands executed against a running mongod instance. This includes CRUD operations as well as configuration and administration commands. The profiler writes all the data it collects to a system.\r\n\r\n37. can we use regular expression in mongodb ?\r\n\r\nMongoDB provides the functionality to search a pattern in a string during a query by writing a regular expression. A regular expression is a generalized way to match patterns with sequences of characters. MongoDB uses Perl compatible regular expressions(PCRE) version 8.42 along with UTF-8 support.\r\n\r\n38. difference between $all and $in operator : -\r\n\r\n$all operator retrieves all the documents which contains the subset of the values we pass. The subset might be in any order. $in operator retrieves all the documents which contains the either of the values we pass.\r\n\r\n$all operator retrieves all the documents which contains the subset of the values we pass. The subset might be in any order. $in operator retrieves all the documents which contains the either of the values we pass.\r\n\r\nThe $in operator is used to select documents in which the field's value equals any of the given values in the array. You can use this operator in methods like find(), update(), etc., according to your requirements.\r\n\r\n39. Add more slaves to replica : -\r\n- Prepare the Data Directory: This is about creating a data directory for the new member and manually copying data to it from an existing member.\r\n- Add a Member to an Existing Replica Set: 2.1 Start the new member's mongod instance, pointing to the new data directory. 2.2 Connect to the replica-set's primary.\r\n\r\n●\r\n\r\n40. Some application of mongodb : -\r\n\r\nIt is used to store a massive amount of demographic and biometric data. For example, India's Unique Identification project, Aadhar is using MongoDB as its database to store a massive amount of demographic and biometric data of more than 1.2 billion Indians.\r\n\r\n41. What is mongoose ?\r\n\r\nMongoose is a MongoDB ODM i.e (Object database Modelling) that used to translate the code and its representation from MongoDB to the Node. js server. Advantages of Mongoose module: Collection validation of the MongoDB database can be done easily.\r\n\r\nMongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database, while Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node. js that provides a higher-level abstraction layer on top of MongoDB, allowing developers to define data models using a schema-based approach.\r\n\r\n42. Mongodb function : -\r\n\r\nA MongoDB Function can be used to read, insert, update, or delete data from your MongoDB database. When you connect your database to Internal, basic functions corresponding to each collection in your database are automatically generated for you.\r\n\r\n43. which mongodb api to use ?\r\n\r\nThe MongoDB Data API can be used to query and update data in a MongoDB database without the need for language specific drivers. Language drivers should be used when possible, but the MongoDB Data API comes in handy when drivers are not available or drivers are overkill for the application.\r\n\r\nMongoDB RESTful API is simple to set up and allows you to store and retrieve documents, making it great for Unstructured Data.\r\n\r\n44. What is storage engine ?\r\n\r\nThe storage engine is the component of the database that is responsible for managing how data is stored, both in memory and on disk. MongoDB supports multiple storage engines, as different engines perform better for specific workloads.\r\n\r\n45. Skip () : -\r\n\r\nMongoDB skip() is used when we required a certain number of results after a certain number of documents simultaneously we have use skip method in MongoDB. If we want to skip a certain number of documents from the collection, skip method will skip the specified documents that we have used with the MongoDB skip method\r\n\r\n46. Text search : -\r\n\r\nFor self-managed (non-Atlas) deployments, MongoDB's text search capability supports query operations that perform a text search of string content. To perform text search, MongoDB uses a text index and the $text operator.\r\n\r\n47. Command syntax : -\r\n\r\nTo run a command against the current database, use db.runCommand() : db. runCommand( { \u003ccommand\u003e } ) To run an administrative command against the admin database, use db.adminCommand() : db.\r\n\r\nWhat is the syntax of find command in MongoDB? Syntax: db. collection\\_name. find(query, projection)\r\n\r\n48. How does NoSQL DB budget memory?\r\n\r\nAns: The Replication Node manages the data in a NoSQL DB store and is the main consumer of memory. The Java heap and cache size used by the Replication Node can be important performance factor\r\n\r\n49. Syntax to create drop collection : -\r\n\r\n**First, check the available collections into your database mydb.**\r\n\r\n- \u003euse mydb switched to db mydb \u003eshow collections mycol mycollection system. indexes tutorialspoint \u003e Now drop the collection with the name mycollection.\r\n- \u003edb. mycollection. drop() true \u003e ...\r\n- \u003eshow collections mycol system. indexes tutorialspoint \u003e\r\n\r\n●\r\n\r\nUse of Drop Collection in MongoDB\r\n\r\nTo remove a collection completely, use the db. collection. drop() method and drop the entire collection, including the indexes and then reuse the collection.\r\n\r\n50. Store capacity in a single mongodb document : -\r\n\r\nThe maximum size an individual document can be in MongoDB is 16MB with a nested depth of 100 levels.\r\n\r\nWe often need to store files in our databases, but mongoDB doesn't let you store any file larger than 16 Mb in a normal document. Instead, MongoDB has a functionality specifically for storing large files and it goes by the name GridFS. GridFS divides the file into chunks and then stores them in the database.\r\n\r\n51. BSON : -\r\n\r\nBSON, or Binary JSON, is the data format that MongoDB uses to organize and store data. This data format includes all JSON data structure types and adds support for types including dates, different size integers, ObjectIds, and binary data.\r\n\r\n52. Supported datatypes in mongodb : -\r\n- String. One of the most basic and widely used data types is the string. ...\r\n- Integer. Numeric values are stored using the integer data type. ...\r\n- Double. Numeric numbers containing 8 bytes (64-bit IEEE 754 floating point) floating-point are stored using the double data type. ...\r\n- Boolean. ...\r\n- Array. ...\r\n- Object. ...\r\n- Date. ...\r\n- Timestamp.\r\n- Null\r\n- Binary\r\n53. pretty() method : -\r\n\r\npretty() method is used to configure the cursor to display results in an easy-to-read format. Syntax: cursor.pretty() The pretty() method has the following prototype form: db.collection.find(\u003cquery\u003e).pretty()\r\n\r\n54. is mongodb supported foreign key and primary key relationship ?\r\n\r\n    No. MongoDB doesn't support primary key-foreign key relationship. MongoDB has \\_id key field for every document that uniquely identifies the particular document.\r\n\r\n55. CURD : -\r\n\r\nThe basic methods of interacting with a MongoDB server are called CRUD operations. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These CRUD methods are the primary ways you will manage the data in your databases.\r\n\r\n56. difference between insert, insertone and insertmany in mongodb ?\r\n\r\n    With insertOne you can insert one document into the collection. insertMany accepts an array of documents and these are inserted. The insert (the method from older versions) takes a single document by default, and there is an option to insert multiple documents supplied as an array.\r\n\r\n57. How to display all the element ?\r\n\r\nTo obtain a list of MongoDB collections, we need to use the Mongo shell command show collections . This command will return all collections created within a MongoDB database.\r\n\r\n58. Bulk write operation : -\r\n\r\nBulk write operations affect a single collection. MongoDB allows applications to determine the acceptable level of acknowledgement required for bulk write operations. The db. collection. bulkWrite() method provides the ability to perform bulk insert, update, and delete operations.\r\n\r\n59. Set () : -\r\n\r\nThe $set operator replaces the value of a field with the specified value. The $set operator expression has the following form: { $set: { \u003cfield1\u003e: \u003cvalue1\u003e, ... } } To specify a \u003cfield\u003e in an embedded document or in an array, use dot notation.\r\n\r\n60. Does MongoDB support collection joins?\r\n\r\nJoin Collections\r\n\r\nMongoDB is not a relational database, but you can perform a left outer join by using the $lookup stage. The $lookup stage lets you specify which collection you want to join with the current collection, and which fields that should match.\r\n\r\n61. how relationship maintained in mongodb ?\r\n\r\nIn MongoDB, one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relations can be implemented in two ways: Using embedded documents. Using the reference of documents of another collection.\r\n\r\n62. model one to one relationship in mongodb : -\r\n\r\nIn this one-to-one relationship between patron and address data, the address belongs to the patron . In the normalized data model, the address document contains a reference to the patron document. With the embedded data model, your application can retrieve the complete patron information with one query.\r\n\r\n63. Model one to many relationship in mongodb : -\r\n\r\nWe can also perform a one-to-many relationship using the document reference model. In this model, we maintain the documents separately but one document contains the reference of the other documents. Now retrieving data from these different documents is cumbersome.\r\n\r\n64. Different ways to model tree structure with mongodb : -\r\n- Model Tree Structures with Parent References.\r\n- Model Tree Structures with Child References.\r\n- Model Tree Structures with an Array of Ancestors.\r\n- Model Tree Structures with Materialized Paths.\r\n- Model Tree Structures with Nested Sets.\r\n\r\n**Creating a tree node**\r\n\r\n- Find parent node document to get the \"ancestors\" for our new node.\r\n- Save the id of parent node and ancestor nodes when adding a new node.\r\n- Add the id of the new node to the parent node's children field.\r\n\r\n●\r\n\r\n64. limit() : -\r\n\r\nIn MongoDB, the limit() method limits the number of records or documents that you want. It basically defines the max limit of records/documents that you want. Or in other words, this method uses on cursor to specify the maximum number of documents/ records the cursor will return.\r\n\r\n65. Sort () : -\r\n\r\nMongoDB can perform sort operations on a single-field index in ascending or descending order. In compound indexes, the sort order determines whether the index can be sorted. The sort keys must be listed in the same order as defined in the index.\r\n\r\n66. Create index : -\r\n\r\nIndexes support efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. If your application is repeatedly running queries on the same fields, you can create an index on those fields to improve performance for those queries. To create an index, use the createIndex() shell method or equivalent method for your driver.\r\n\r\n67. Mongodb projection : -\r\n\r\nMongoDB projection is a powerful tool that can be used to extract only the fields you need from a document—not all fields. It enables you to: Project concise and transparent data. Filter the data set without impacting the overall database performance\r\n\r\n68. which index is created by mongodb in every collection ?\r\n\r\n    \\_id index\r\n\r\n    MongoDB creates a unique index on the \\_id field during the creation of a collection. The \\_id index prevents clients from inserting two documents with the same value for the \\_id field.\r\n\r\n69. component of sharded cluster in mongodb : -\r\n\r\nA sharded cluster in MongoDB is a collection of datasets distributed across many shards (servers) in order to achieve horizontal scalability and better performance in read and write operations. Sharding is very useful for collections that have a lot of data and high query rates.\r\n\r\n- Sharded Cluster Components. Shards. ...\r\n- Shard Keys.\r\n- Hashed Sharding. Deploy Sharded Cluster using Hashed Sharding.\r\n- Ranged Sharding. Deploy Sharded Cluster using Ranged Sharding.\r\n- Tag Aware Sharding. Manage Shard Tags. ...\r\n- Data Partitioning with Chunks. Create Chunks in a Sharded Cluster. ...\r\n- Balancer. ...\r\n- Administration.\r\n70. Shard key : -\r\n\r\nThe shard key is either a single indexed field or multiple fields covered by a compound index that determines the distribution of the collection's documents among the cluster's shards.\r\n\r\n71. Accumulator operator : -\r\n\r\nAccumulators are operators that maintain their state (e.g. totals, maximums, minimums, and related data) as documents progress through the pipeline. Use the $accumulator operator to execute your own JavaScript functions to implement behavior not supported by the MongoDB Query Language.\r\n\r\n72. What is the use of $project in MongoDB?\r\n\r\nThe $project takes a document that can specify the inclusion of fields, the suppression of the \\_id field, the addition of new fields, and the resetting of the values of existing fields. Alternatively, you may specify the exclusion of fields.\r\n\r\n73. What is the use of $match in MongoDB ?\r\n\r\n$match. Filters the documents to pass only the documents that match the specified condition(s) to the next pipeline stage.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of match in mongoose?\r\n\r\nmatch() function of the Mongoose API is used to find the existing documents in the database that matches the conditions mentioned in the arguments of the API.\r\n\r\n74. Why is \u0026group used in MongoDB?\r\n\r\n$group. The $group stage separates documents into groups according to a \"group key\". The output is one document for each unique group key. A group key is often a field, or group of fields.\r\n\r\nWe are also using the group method to group the documents in MongoDB. Using the group method we are grouping by two or multiple field in MongoDB. Group method will accept the single document from the collection. Basically group method is similar to group by clause which was used in other SQL databases.\r\n\r\n75. What is the use of $unwind in MongoDB ?\r\n\r\nThe $unwind operator in MongoDB is used to deconstruct an array field into multiple documents. It creates a new document for each element in the array, effectively \"unwinding\" the array.\r\n\r\n76. What is the use of $lookup in MongoDB ?\r\n\r\n$lookup performs an equality match on the localField to the foreignField from the documents of the from collection. If an input document does not contain the localField , the $lookup treats the field as having a value of null for matching purposes.\r\n\r\n77. feature to do safe backup in MongoDB : -\r\n\r\nIn general, if using filesystem based backups for MongoDB Enterprise 4.2+, use the \"hot\" backup feature, if possible. For MongoDB Enterprise versions 4.0 and earlier, if you use AES256-GCM encryption mode, do not make copies of your data files or restore from filesystem snapshots (\"hot\" or \"cold\").\r\n\r\nMongoDB Backup and Restore Best Practices\r\n\r\nMongoDB uses both regular JSON and Binary JSON (BSON) file formats. It's better to use BSON when backing up and restoring. While JSON is easy to work with, it doesn't support all of the data types that BSON supports, and it may lead to the loss of fidelity.\r\n\r\n78. What is the backup method of MongoDB?\r\n\r\n**MongoDB Backup Methods**\r\n\r\n- Back Up with Atlas.\r\n- Back Up with MongoDB Cloud Manager or Ops Manager.\r\n- Back Up by Copying Underlying Data Files.\r\n- Back Up with mongodump.\r\n79. What is configuration in MongoDB?\r\n\r\nThe MongoDB configuration file contains settings that are equivalent to the command-line options mongod and mongos. Using a MongoDB configuration file simplifies the management of mongod and mongos options, especially in large-scale deployments.\r\n\r\n80. Use of Ops manager : -\r\n\r\nOps Manager is the self-hosted management platform that enables you to deploy, monitor, back up, and scale MongoDB on your own infrastructure. Identify issues before they become emergencies and streamline operations.\r\n\r\n- Configure Deployment to Have Limited Internet Access. ...\r\n- Enable Backing Database Monitoring.\r\n- Deploy a Highly Available Application.\r\n- Deploy Highly Available Backups.\r\n- Configure Ops Manager to Monitor Large Deployments.\r\n- Assign Snapshot Stores to Specific Data Centers.\r\n- Pass Outgoing Traffic through HTTP Proxy.\r\n\r\n*THANK YOU -*\r\n"},{"slug":"getting-started-with-nextjs","title":"Getting Started with NextJS","date":"2022-10-16","image":"getting-started-nextjs.png","excerpt":"NextJS is a the React framework for production - it makes building fullstack React apps and sites a breeze and ships with built-in SSR.","isFeatured":true,"content":"\nNextJS is a **framework for ReactJS**.\n\nWait a second ... a \"framework\" for React?

What is html tag, element, attribute ?\r\n\r\n   **HTML Tags:** Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element. They begin with \u003c symbol and end with \u003e symbol. Whatever written inside \u003c and \u003e are called tags.\r\n\r\n   **HTML elements:** Elements enclose the contents in between the tags. They consist of some kind of structure or expression. It generally consists of a start tag, content and an end tag.\r\n\r\n   **HTML Attributes:** It is used to define the character of an HTML element. It always placed in the opening tag of an element. It generally provides additional styling (attribute) to the element.\r\n\r\n3. Marquee : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003cmarquee\u003e tag in HTML is used to create scrolling text or image in a webpages. It scrolls either from horizontally left to right or right to left, or vertically top to bottom or bottom to top.\r\n\r\n4. List : -\r\n\r\nHTML Lists are used to specify lists of information. All lists may contain one or more list elements. There are three different types of HTML lists: Ordered List or Numbered List\r\n\r\n(ol) Unordered List or Bulleted List (ul). Each list item starts with the \u003cli\u003e tag.\r\n\r\n5. Table : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003ctable\u003e tag defines an HTML table. An HTML table consists of one \u003ctable\u003e element and one or more \u003ctr\u003e, \u003cth\u003e, and \u003ctd\u003e elements. The \u003ctr\u003e element defines a table row, the \u003cth\u003e element defines a table header, and the \u003ctd\u003e element defines a table cell.\r\n\r\n6. Copy : - \u0026#169 , @copy\r\n6. White space : -\r\n\r\nWhitespace is any string of text composed only of spaces, tabs or line breaks (to be precise, CRLF sequences, carriage returns or line feeds). The whiteSpace property sets or returns how to handle tabs, line breaks and whitespace in a text.\r\n\r\n8. Anchor tag / Hyperlink : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003ca\u003e tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the \u003ca\u003e element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers: An unvisited link is underlined and blue.\r\n\r\n9. Semantic html : -\r\n\r\nA semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: \u003cdiv\u003e and \u003cspan\u003e - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: \u003cform\u003e , \u003ctable\u003e , and \u003carticle\u003e - Clearly defines its content.\r\n\r\n10. SVG : -\r\n\r\nSVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. SVG is used to define graphics for the Web.\r\n\r\nThe SVG file format is a popular tool for displaying two-dimensional graphics, charts, and illustrations on websites. Plus, as a vector file, it can be scaled up or down without losing any of its resolution.\r\n\r\n11. i-frame tag : -\r\n\r\nWhat is inline frame (iframe)? An inline frame (iframe) is a HTML element that loads another HTML page within the document. It essentially puts another webpage within the parent page. They are commonly used for advertisements, embedded videos, web analytics and interactive content.\r\n\r\n12. Imp of doctype : -\r\n\r\nPer HTML and XHTML standards, a DOCTYPE (short for “document type declaration”) informs the web browser which version of HTML you're using, and should appear at the very top of every web page. DOCTYPE's are a key component of standards-compliant web pages, plus your code won't render correctly or validate without them.\r\n\r\n13. Metadata : -\r\n\r\nMetadata is data (information) about data. \u003cmeta\u003e tags always go inside the \u003chead\u003e element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.\r\n\r\n14. Pre tag : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003cpre\u003e tag defines preformatted text. Text in a \u003cpre\u003e element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks. The text will be displayed exactly as written in the HTML source code.\r\n\r\n15. Div and span tag : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003cspan\u003e tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The \u003cspan\u003e tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The \u003cspan\u003e tag is much like the \u003cdiv\u003e element, but \u003cdiv\u003e is a block-level element and \u003cspan\u003e is an inline element.\r\n\r\n16. GET VS POST :-\r\n\r\nBoth GET and POST method is used to transfer data from client to server in HTTP protocol but Main difference between POST and GET method is that GET carries request parameter appended in URL string while POST carries request parameter in message body which makes it more secure way of transferring data from client to …\r\n\r\n17. Html vs html 5 : -\r\n\r\nHTML5 is a new version of HTML with new functionalities with markup language with Internet technologies. HTML does not have support for video and audio but, HTML5 supports both video and audio. You must be visiting many websites every day. Let us talk about an online shopping website.\r\n\r\n18. Frames : -\r\n\r\nHTML frames are used to divide your browser window into multiple sections where each section can load a separate HTML document. A collection of frames in the browser window is known as a frameset. The window is divided into frames in a similar way the tables are organized: into rows and columns.\r\n\r\n19. Inline vs block level element : -\r\n\r\nBlock elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element. Block elements have top and bottom margins. Inline elements don't have a top and bottom margin.\r\n\r\n20. Viewport : -\r\n\r\nThe viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.\r\n\r\nThe viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.\r\n\r\nBefore tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.\r\n\r\nThis gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.\r\n\r\nThe width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).\r\n\r\nThe initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.\r\n\r\n21. Cell spacing vs cell padding : -\r\n\r\nBoth cellpadding and cellspacing are used to insert whitespaces in the table cells. The most basic difference between cellpadding and cellspacing is that the cellpadding is used to set the whitespace between cell edge and cell content, whereas cellspacing is used to set the whitespace between two cells.\r\n\r\n22. Web workers : -\r\n\r\nA web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.\r\n\r\n23. Id vs class : -\r\n\r\nRemember the difference between Class and ID: A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must only be used by one HTML element within the page\r\n\r\n24. Formatting tag : -\r\n\r\nHTML Formatting is a process that allows us to format text to increase its visual appeal. Various HTML tags can change how text appears on a web page and make the text attractive. We can use HTML text formatting tags to bold, italicize, underlined text, and do more.\r\n\r\n25. Link : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003clink\u003e tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. The \u003clink\u003e tag is most often used to link to external style sheets or to add a favicon to your website.\r\n\r\n26. Image map : -\r\n\r\nAn image map is an image with clickable areas. The required name attribute of the \u003cmap\u003e element is associated with the \u003cimg\u003e's usemap attribute and creates a relationship between the image and the map. The \u003cmap\u003e element contains a number of \u003carea\u003e elements, that defines the clickable areas in the image map.\r\n\r\n27. Layout : -\r\n\r\nAn HTML layout is a blueprint used to arrange web pages in a well-defined manner. It is easy to navigate, simple to understand and uses HTML tags to customize web design elements. Crucial for any website, an HTML layout that uses the correct format will easily improve a website's appearance.\r\n\r\n28. Local storage vs Session storage : -\r\n\r\nThe difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page\r\n\r\nsessions are valid for only one tab at a time.\r\n\r\n29. Media types \u0026 Formats : -\r\n\r\nMultimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files. The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension. Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.\r\n\r\n30. Html vs Xhtml : -\r\n\r\nHTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, whereas XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. XHTML is basically an extension of HTML, which is stricter than HTML. Both languages are used to create web and Android applications. HTML is SGML based, whereas XHTML is an XML-based language.\r\n\r\n31. Input tag : -\r\n\r\nDefinition and Usage. The \u003cinput\u003e tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data. The \u003cinput\u003e element is the most important form element. The \u003cinput\u003e element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.\r\n\r\n32. Form : -\r\n\r\nHTML Form is a document that stores information of a user on a web server using interactive controls. An HTML form contains different kinds of information such as username, password, contact number, email id, etc. The elements used in an HTML form are the check box, input box, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.\r\n\r\n33. Range slider : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003cinput type=\"range\"\u003e defines a control for entering a number whose exact value is not important (like a slider control). Default range is 0 to 100. However, you can set restrictions on what numbers are accepted with the attributes below.\r\n\r\n34. Entities : -\r\n\r\nHTML entities are the reserved characters that are used in the HTML document. They are not present in your standard keyboard. They provide a wide range of characters, allowing you to add icons, geometric shapes, mathematical operators, and so on.\r\n\r\n35. Optimize website asset : -\r\n\r\nOptimizing website asset loading involves a meticulous process of enhancing the delivery of various elements that make up a web page, including images, scripts, stylesheets, fonts, and multimedia content. The goal is to reduce loading times while maintaining or even enhancing the quality of the user experience.\r\n\r\n36. URL Encoding : -\r\n\r\nURL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet. URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a \"%\" followed by hexadecimal digits. URLs cannot contain spaces.\r\n\r\n37. Datalist tag : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003cdatalist\u003e tag specifies a list of pre-defined options for an \u003cinput\u003e element. The \u003cdatalist\u003e tag is used to provide an \"autocomplete\" feature for \u003cinput\u003e elements. Users will see a drop-down list of pre-defined options as they input data.\r\n\r\n38. Canvas element : -\r\n\r\nThe HTML \u003ccanvas\u003e element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The \u003ccanvas\u003e element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.\r\n\r\n\\- css -\r\n\r\n1\\.What is css : -\r\n\r\nCSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files\r\n\r\n2. Types : -\r\n\r\n**There are three types of CSS which are given below:**\r\n\r\n- Inline CSS.\r\n- Internal or Embedded CSS.\r\n- External CSS.\r\n3. Css selectors : -\r\n\r\nCSS selectors are used to \"find\" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.\r\n\r\nWe can divide CSS selectors into five categories:\r\n\r\n- Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)\r\n- [Combinator selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp) (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)\r\n- [Pseudo-class selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp) (select elements based on a certain state)\r\n- [Pseudo-elements selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp) (select and style a part of an element)\r\n- [Attribute selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_attribute_selectors.asp) (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)\r\n4. Universal selector : -\r\n\r\nThe asterisk (\\*) is known as the CSS universal selectors. It can be used to select any and all types of elements in an HTML page. The asterisk can also be followed by a selector while using to select a child object. This selector is useful when we want to select all the elements on the page.\r\n\r\n5. Box sizing : -\r\n\r\nThe box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height. If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height: Both divs are the same size now!\r\n\r\n6. Hide an element : -\r\n\r\nYou can hide an element in CSS using the CSS properties display: none or visibility: hidden . display: none removes the entire element from the page and mat affect the layout of the page.\r\n\r\n7. Flex model : -\r\n\r\nThe flexbox or flexible box model in CSS is a one-dimensional layout model that has flexible and efficient layouts with distributed spaces among items to control their alignment structure ie., it is a layout model that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items within a container.\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world of browser support, the reason you'd choose to use flexbox is because you want to lay a collection of items out in one direction or another. As you lay out your items you want to control the dimensions of the items in that one dimension, or control the spacing between items.\r\n\r\n8. Important : -\r\n\r\nThe !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal. In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!\r\n\r\n9. Css Sprites : -\r\n\r\nCSS Sprites are a collection of images that are combined into a single file that an HTML document can access. These images are then called into use within the HTML code to be displayed on the website.\r\n\r\n10. Pseudo class / Pseudo element : -\r\n\r\nIn CSS, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are two types of keywords that you can combine with selectors. They are used to target the element's state or specific parts of an element.\r\n\r\nA CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class :hover can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can then be styled.\r\n\r\n11. SASS , LESS , STYLUS : -\r\n\r\nLESS is pretty intuitive and more CSS-like.\r\n\r\nSASS is more programmatic than it is CSS-like, although it supports all versions of CSS.\r\n\r\nStylus is more concise, intuitive and is just as programmatic as SASS. This is due to the fact that they are both imperatively styled.\r\n\r\n12. Position relative vs Position absolute : -\r\n\r\na relative position moves the element, but still consumes some space in the original position. an absolute or fixed position moves the element, but does not consume any layout space.\r\n\r\n13. VH : -\r\n\r\nThe full form of VH is viewport height. It works like the percentage unit as well. Specifying 10vh is equivalent to occupying 10% of entire visible screen height.\r\n\r\n14. CSS3 vs CSS2 : -\r\n\r\nCSS3 has compatibility with external font styles through google fonts and typecast. It was not possible with earlier CSS1 and CSS2. The selectors in CSS3 has increased while CSS1 and CSS2 only had simple selectors. CSS1 AND CSS2 didn't have provision to specifically design the web layout.CSS3 is now split into different modules. Since each module makes its way through the W3C individually, there's a wider range of browser support. Make sure you test your CSS3 pages in as many browsers and operating systems as possible to ensure compatibility\r\n\r\n15. RGB stream : -\r\n\r\nRGB represents colors in CSS. There are three streams in this nomenclature representing a color, namely the Red, Green, and Blue streams. The intensity of colors is represented using numbers 0 to 255. This allows CSS to have a spectrum of visible colors.\r\n\r\n16. Class vs Id : -\r\n\r\nWhile an ID is specific to a single element, classes can be assigned to multiple elements on a page or throughout the website. They are not unique. And while a single element can only have one ID, it can have multiple classes.\r\n\r\nTo select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.\r\n\r\nTo select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.\r\n\r\n17. Z-index : -\r\n\r\nZ Index ( z-index ) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index. Note: Z index only works on positioned elements ( position:absolute , position:relative , or position:fixed ).\r\n\r\n18. Media types : -\r\n\r\nThe @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.\r\n\r\nExamples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.![](Aspose.Words.fc9b058b-e705-4e5e-a7d2-b93d9b27b1f7.001.png)\r\n\r\nCSS3 Introduced Media Queries\r\n\r\nMedia queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.\r\n\r\nMedia queries can be used to check many things, such as:\r\n\r\n- width and height of the viewport\r\n- width and height of the device\r\n- orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)\r\n- resolution\r\n\r\nUsing media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).\r\n\r\n19. Image repetition : -\r\n\r\nThe CSS background-repeat is what you're looking for. If you want the background image not to repeat at all, use background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n\r\n20. Image scroll : -\r\n\r\nBackground-repeat : none; Background-attachment : fixed;\r\n\r\n21. Font related attributes : -\r\n- font-family.\r\n- font-size.\r\n- font-stretch.\r\n- font-style.\r\n- font-variant.\r\n- font-weight.\r\n- line-height.\r\n22. Contextual selectors : -\r\n\r\nA contextual selector matches when an element is an arbitrary descendent of some ancestor element (i.e., it may be any generation below the ancestor element). A contextual selector is made up of two or more selectors separated by white space.\r\n\r\nContextual selectors allow the developer to select different types of styles for different parts of the document. In CSS, the developer can either specify styles directly or by making certain classes. The contextual selector will only apply the style to the elements which are specified.\r\n\r\n23. Css nomenclature : -\r\n\r\nThe CSS class naming convention defines rules for choosing the character sequences for naming a CSS class to reduce the effort needed to read and understand the code. There are various naming conventions, like using hyphen-delimited strings, BEM(Block-Element-Modifier), OOCSS(Object-oriented CSS), etc.\r\n\r\n- Naming Convention Basics.\r\n- Do Not Use Special Characters.\r\n- Do Not Use Any Spaces.\r\n- The Filename Should Start With a Letter.\r\n- Use All Lower Case.\r\n- Keep the Filename as Short as Possible.\r\n- The Most Important Part of Your CSS Filename.\r\n- CSS File-Naming Conventions.\r\n24. When should you use translate () instead of absolute positioning in\r\n\r\nCSS?\r\n\r\nUse translate() when you need to move an element without affecting the layout of other elements on the page. Consider using translate() instead of absolute positioning in scenarios such as animations, responsive design, and small adjustments to element positions.\r\n\r\n25. Position some aspect : -\r\n\r\nThe \u003cposition\u003e (or \u003cbg-position\u003e ) CSS data type denotes a two-dimensional coordinate used to set a location relative to an element box. It is used in the background-position and offset-anchor properties. Note: The final position described by the \u003cposition\u003e value does not need to be inside the element's box\r\n\r\n26. Mixins : -\r\n\r\nA mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. Here's an example for theme . SCSS.\r\n\r\nMixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet. They make it easy to avoid using non-semantic classes like .float-left , and to distribute collections of styles in libraries.\r\n\r\n27. How does browser work under the hood?\r\n\r\nEach browser has a browser engine under the hood. It works as a bridge between the user interface and the rendering engine. It queries and manipulates the rendering engine based on the input it gets from the user interface.\r\n\r\n28. Float : -\r\n\r\nThe float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning).\r\n\r\n29. Logical vs physical tag : -\r\n\r\na logical tag is a tag that describes the meaning or structure of the content it surrounds, while a physical tag describes the presentation or appearance of the content.\r\n\r\n30. Image scripts : -\r\n\r\nAn image sprite is a collection of images put into a single image. A web page with many images can take a long time to load and generates multiple server requests. Using image sprites will reduce the number of server requests and save bandwidth.\r\n\r\n31. Position static : -\r\n\r\nThe position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.\r\n\r\nThere are five different position values:\r\n\r\n- static\r\n- relative\r\n- fixed\r\n- absolute\r\n- sticky ●\r\n32. Attribute selectors : -\r\n\r\nThis type of attribute selector is used to select all the elements that have the specified attribute and applies the CSS property to that attribute. For example, the selector [class] will select all the elements with the style attribute\r\n\r\n33. Child selectors : -\r\n\r\nThe child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.\r\n\r\n34. Css framework : -\r\n\r\n**Top 5 CSS Frameworks for Developers and Designers**\r\n\r\n- Bootstrap.\r\n- Tailwind CSS.\r\n- Foundation.\r\n- Bulma.\r\n- Skeleton.\r\n35. Ruleset : -\r\n\r\nThe CSS Ruleset is used to apply a set of properties with some define values for the element or a specific set of elements that are used in the HTML page.\r\n\r\n36. Embedded style sheet : -\r\n\r\nIt allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. This is done by embedding the \u003cstyle\u003e\u003c/style\u003e tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document.\r\n\r\n37. Reset vs normalize css : -\r\n\r\nNormalizing retains the default styles that are useful and removes those that are not whereas the reset removes all the styles of the browser. In reset, we will have to re declare all the styles after resetting the browser whereas, normalizing will keep the required styles and only removes the unwanted ones\r\n\r\n38. Adaptive vs responsive desing : -\r\n\r\nA responsive design can change its layout and appearance based on the screen size of the device it's accessed on, from a large desktop computer to a small mobile phone. An adaptive design requires the creation of a different layout for each device the website will be accessed on\r\n\r\n39. Center a div : -\r\n\r\n.parent {\r\n\r\nbackground: gray; height: 300px; width: 300px; position: relative;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n.child {\r\n\r\nbackground-color: orange; position: absolute;\r\n\r\ntop: 50%;\r\n\r\nleft: 50%;\r\n\r\ntransform: translate(-50%,-50%);\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n40. Grid system : -\r\n\r\nThe CSS grid layout module excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives. Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows.\r\n\r\n41. Grid vs flex box : -\r\n\r\nThe basic difference between CSS grid layout and CSS flexbox layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.\r\n\r\n42. Progressive rendering : -\r\n\r\nIn progressive Rendering, the web page is divided into different parts on the basis of priority. So different parts will be rendered sequentially according to Server-Side Rendering and sent to the client side\r\n\r\n43. Reset.css file : -\r\n\r\nA CSS Reset file circumvents inconsistencies across different browsers when developing websites. All browsers have default rules with properties and values applied to all pages before loading files. Due to the cascading nature of CSS, any styles the browser uses will remain unless explicitly overridden\r\n\r\n44. Box model vs box sizing : -\r\n\r\nThe box model refers to the composition of elements on a page. When you specify the height or width of an element, you're setting the content size—any padding, border, and margin will be added to that. Applying box-sizing: border-box to an element changes the box model to a more predictable behavior.\r\n\r\n45. Css variables : -\r\n\r\nThe var() function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable.\r\n\r\nCSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that you can create variables with local or global scope, change the variables with JavaScript, and change the variables based on media queries.\r\n\r\nA good way to use CSS variables is when it comes to the colors of your design. Instead of copy and paste the same colors over and over again, you can place them in variables.\r\n\r\n46. Display property : -\r\n\r\nThe display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline box and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex. Formally, the display property sets an element's inner and outer display types.\r\n\r\n47. Direct child selectors and descendent child selector in css : -\r\n\r\n    The Child Combinator (\u003e) only selects those HTML Elements that are direct children of a specified element. While the Descendant Combinator selects all HTML Elements that are either children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and so on. They all are descendants of a specified element and thus all are selected.\r\n\r\n48. Margin vs padding : -\r\n\r\nIn CSS, a margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.\r\n\r\n49. Media breakpoint for responsive : -\r\n- Mobile devices – 320px — 480px.\r\n- iPads, Tablets – 481px — 768px.\r\n- Small screens, laptops – 769px — 1024px.\r\n- Desktops, large screens – 1025px — 1200px.\r\n- Extra large screens, TV – 1201px, and more.\r\n50. Bem methodology : -\r\n\r\nBEM is a front-end naming method for organizing and naming CSS classes. The Block, Element, Modifier methodology is a popular naming convention for class names in HTML and CSS\r\n\r\n51. Em vs rem : -\r\n\r\nBasically that both rem and em are scalable and relative units of size, but with em, the unit is relative to the font size of its parent element, while the rem unit is only relative to the root font size of the HTML document. The “r” in rem stands for “root”\r\n\r\n52. Specificity : -\r\n\r\nIf there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will \"win\", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.\r\n\r\n53. Diff b/w static,relative,absolute and fixed position : -\r\n\r\n    Static - this is the default value, all elements are in order as they appear in the document. Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position. Absolute - the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent. Fixed - the element is positioned related to the browser window.\r\n\r\n54. Gradient : -\r\n\r\nGradient Backgrounds. CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors. CSS defines three types of gradients: Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally) Radial Gradients (defined by their center)\r\n\r\n55. Calc () : -\r\n\r\nIt can be used to calculate length, percentage, time, number, integer frequency, or angle. It uses the four simple arithmetic operators add (+), multiply (\\*), subtract (-), and divide (/). It is a powerful CSS concept because it allows us to mix any units, such as percentage and pixel.\r\n\r\n56. Word wrap : -\r\n\r\nThe word-wrap property allows long words to be able to be broken and wrap onto the next line.\r\n\r\n57. Shadow effect : -\r\n\r\nWith CSS you can add shadow to text and to elements.\r\n\r\nh1 { text-shadow: 2px 2px;}\r\n\r\n58. Transition : -\r\n\r\nCSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.\r\n\r\n**THANK YOU**\r\n\r\n**(*AKKI)***\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"slug":"mastering-javascript","title":"Mastering JavaScript","excerpt":"JavaScript is the most important programming language for web development.
